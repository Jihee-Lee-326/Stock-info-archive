1,"There's a small sell-off virtually every time they announce new products."", ""I wonder if I will finally be able to search my email in a reliable manner."
2,Or if Apple will stop creating 5 contacts for the same person in 3 different address books.
3,"I won't hold my breath."", ""Apple is one of the most valuable companies on the planet, I don't think anyone sane is underestimating them, even if there's some skepticism over their current direction with AI."", 'It does seem very well integrated into the entire ecosystem and apps."
4,"And I think in the near future, you‚Äòll be able to choose whatever AI model you want to go hand in hand with Apple Intelligence so that‚Äòs a big plus as well."
5,"It also helps them catch up, because their own model while light weight and competent enough, is not on the level of Chatgpt yet."
6,Some privacy focus is also great to hear about.
7,"The stock market didn‚Äòt like it, but I‚Äòm very excited for it and what‚Äòs ahead.', 'I think so too, iPhone 16 generation should get a big release later this year too.', 'I think gating the AI features to only iPhone 15 and newer is a great move."
8,Lots of sentiment over the past year have been not upgrading their iphone unless there are significant changes.
9,"Well here it is and a sizable number of iphone users who are still on iphone 10-14 are going to buy iphone 16.', ""Did anybody catch if the new Siri is rolling out on all recent phones, or just this year's line up?"
10,"On one slide, they just showed one of the A chips."
11,Edit: Apple is only making AI available on 15 pro (this year's top model) and later.
12,"So, on the downside, my 14 pro max won't have it, with only 6 GB of RAM."
13,"Of course, Apple could quantize their model to run on 6 GB of RAM, but they opted not to."
14,"So, driving upgrades is their AI monetization model, which is bad for me as a consumer but fine as an investor."
15,"I'm going to continue to hold Apple, and hold AAPU only for another couple days (which is a very modest position)."
16,"Hoping for no whammies with the Fed meeting, though no one is expecting a cut right now."", 'I‚Äôm conflicted for sure."
17,On one hand I think Apple understands its core revenue well and how to both keep users and investors happy.
18,Some of the features seemed targeted at keeping the Apple ecosystem special and walled off from android.
19,"That blue/green text message thing, while kind of dumb when you think about it, was definitely a big deal for keeping Apple users around."
20,"On the other hand I‚Äôm not seeing any big differentiators, any huge value-adds that change the current iPhone revenue."
21,Is any of this going to drive more device purchases?
22,Probably not.
23,Apple has been ramping their service offerings up for a while to drive more revenue.
24,But their primary is still in device sales.
25,"Without that new consumer product innovation in the last few years (Vision notwithstanding) I feel like Apple might be peaking for a few years.', 'Your post could have otherwise be written as ""I have an iPhone and think it\'s the best, so I\'ll buy more stock based on them saying something something AI""', 'I love what I saw."
26,Will we see crazy growth like before?
27,"Maybe not, but this continues to be  strong company who delivers high quality products to the consumer and I think it‚Äôs a great stock to hold for a while still.', 'Seems like it‚Äôs been a soft aapl all year, no?"
28,"I‚Äôm long but SPY is outperforming all year.', 'Ah yes the good ol *1% drop sell off*', 'It would appear things have reversed slightly  :)', 'That‚Äôs interesting."
29,"You look at Google, at Amazon, Microsoft, they‚Äôre all heavily into AI for the enterprise, the cloud, server space."
30,"AI for business processes, algorithms etc."
31,which makes sense.
32,They don‚Äôt make their money from the consumer.
33,And here‚Äôs Apple.
34,A consumer facing company.
35,Makes sense all their AI endeavors will be in the consumer space.
36,Is there even another major player in the race?
37,"Might take a while before something more substantial than a beta release comes out, but Apple might actually be first in for once."
38,"If they can pull it off.', ""I still haven't heard how Apple makes money from AI."

43,"The only thing that honestly wowed me was the math scripting', ""Ai integration doesn't really do much."
44,How does this actually make Apple money?
45,Are they gonna make people pay for it?
46,"Or is it gonna only be included with Apple one?"", ""I'm AI with the braids"", 'ultimate spying on a phone with processing power to beat the competition; i‚Äôd be hesitant of privacy and deep knowledge that it‚Äôll have about my work and personal life', 'I‚Äôm way more excited about the apps and games they will make with this.', 'Wow, this thread is not censored by the moderators."
47,I posted opinions on Disney and the moderators took it down.
48,"I think the moderators pick and choose what they think is in a legitimate opinion or not crap thread.', 'Nice call, OP."
49,"Not only this, but it also validates a bunch of use cases for AI ‚Äî and by that measure, some of the spending going on for servers, chips, and equipment.', ""It's really crazy how a shitty AI update pushed them up to nearly 3.5T"", 'I‚Äôm one year into the AI surge."
50,"Absolutely nothing in my life has changed except I click return more often when writing texts.', ""Elon Musk just said that he's banning Apple devices at all of his companies if OpenAI is integrated into IOS."
51,"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800265431078551973"", '> They are bringing AI to day to day activities, to the masses."
52,"I loved the display where siri lights up the entire phone, because it highlights that AI really obsoletes apps."
53,Without apps how will apple make money?
54,Frankly most apps can work with a featurephone if they are integrated with AI.
55,"Apple should focus on media consumption, which is what gives premium value to their devices."
56,"AI will eat their own lunch.', 'Watched the event and it is very under-whelming."
57,"It seems Apple last  lost the mojo', 'Hope you bought the dip', 'I am fully invested in Ai , specifically OpenAi."
58,"what does this mean for microsofts investment in openAi?', 'I don‚Äôt like AI period."
59,"Too much for nothing or are we getting lazy?', 'Finder is still finder."
60,"Which is a deal breaker.', 'I hope so."
61,"Over the last few months Apple became my biggest position', 'Let us be honest here."
62,Apple hasnt made a ground breaking device ever.
63,"They always make a smoother and attractive looking device with much much limited functionality under the guise of security.', 'AI‚Ä¶ Bringing something no one asked for or cared about."
64,No revenue path much less a profit path for AI.
65,Currently is weak and slow and consistently incorrect in the few things it can do.
66,This is extremely bearish‚Ä¶ Maybe in another 5 - 10 years it‚Äôll mature into something actually useful and that the general populace wants to have.
67,But in the right here and right now.
68,"This is a massive L.', 'AAPL:  growth = negative  P/E ratio = 30  GOOG: growth ‚âà 15% PE ratio = 27  How is it underestimatedÔºü', ""I guess I am the outlier based on talking heads on TV, I found apple announcement a hoe hum moment."
69,Putting AI in siri.
70,"Siri sucks now, probably the worst product in apple's portfolio."
71,"I personally have never used vision pro, heard good and bad."
72,"But I missed how this makes apple more money,  new phone not ready yet."
73,Maybe it was my expectation that new phone with AI was coming out.
74,"I think AAPL heading back to 175 range for a couple more quarters"", 'Direct user-interfacing AI on a personal device is such a small part of the overall AI market, it\'s unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple\'s bottom line, other than keeping them competitive."
75,Better on-device AI isn\'t going to sell more devices for Apple.
76,"It\'s already an expected part of the user experience, so offering it is essential, yes, but it\'s not a *differentiator*."
77,"This announcement really is no more substantial than Apple\'s Maps app when the market was already dominated by Google, or their voice control (Siri) when it was already a standard offering on other platforms."
78,"""Me too"" in no way makes them a leader in the AI growth market.', ""It's easy to underestimate Apple's performance because of their incredible ability to retain market share with their cult-like following."
79,"It's hard to underestimate their products because they're overpriced trash, but don't let that distract you from the fact that they know how to milk money from their customer base."
80,"That said, they're still pretty high right now, the tech sector is very inflated."", 'Its probably because the news were out dated , everything they showcased is already out years now, the fact that apple is also doing it is what keeps the stock so high, but dont expect some jump simply because they said ‚Äúlook we will do it too‚Äù', ""I was sceptical of APPL about 3 months back, but with them currently near ATH and that presentation..."
81,yeah I think they're going to decline from here on out.
82,"Reading the comments here with someone seriously arguing that 'custom generated images and emoji specific to the conversation,' will be some kind of big selling point I believe I was right to enter a short position yesterday."
83,"Should be an easy 15% - 20% in the next three months."", 'Agreed."
84,And we reached levels not seen since...
85,"last week.', 'I was told there would be a sell-off after WWDC every year."
86,"I sold all my shares yesterday morning so therefore the stock is up even more now.', 'ooof', 'Nah, OP is in full panic mode trying to pretend like Apple somehow made AI mainstream."
87,Apple has lost their touch.
88,Their last sucessful product was a pair or in ears and since thees been nothing.
89,Their attempt at AI is both late and weak.
90,"No wonder Apple is losing customers hard all over the world (US as the lone exception, because ""tech is scary"" for people 50+)', 'The worst', 'Skepticism?"
91,"They quelled that today', 'It‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt make them anyone money it‚Äôs just a slight improvement to the UX.', 'Reading the Apple Intelligence page,  >""Apple Intelligence will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later, with Siri and device language set to U.S."
92,"English.""  For Apple Intelligence, it needs IPhone 15 Pro."
93,"Iphone 15, 15plus or older models won\'t run Apple intelligence."
94,"As I understand it from reading the page, the OpenAI Chatgpt integration is free and will be available on all phones with ios18 ( the doc is not very clear about it, so I can be wrong)."
95,">""Privacy protections are built in for users who access ChatGPT ‚Äî their IP addresses are obscured, and OpenAI won‚Äôt store requests."
96,"ChatGPT‚Äôs data-use policies apply for users who choose to connect their account.ChatGPT will come to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia later this year, powered by GPT-4o.""', 'Yup."
97,"Obviously I am just one person, but I was going to keep my 13 pro max as long as I could."
98,I will most likely upgrade now.
99,Is it annoying?
100,"Sure, I suppose."
101,Did they get me to upgrade my phone?
102,Yes.
103,"So smart business decision imo', 'Wish it was on the iPhone 15 I just bought."
104,"But tbh I don‚Äôt see myself using it much on the phone, more so the mac', 'Not just the iPhone 15 but you need the flagship model to use the AI features - Pro/Pro Max     I‚Äôm interested to find out if the non-pro 16 will have the capabilities', ""I don't think we know yet, but it'd be smarter for Apple to make it work with the last few generations of phones, if possible."", 'Only the 15 pro and 15 pro max will have it."
105,"Not sure if the non-pro 16 will have it.', ""> Apple could quantize their model  and have a model that doesn't perform as well as they want to..."
106,"they don't want to become a laughing stock, like with Siri, again"", 'Most of us upgrade our phones after 2-5 years anyway so people will eventually switch."
107,"I already bought a 15 pro last year after using an 2nd gen SE for 3.5 years, so it‚Äôs just a nice bonus feature."
108,"The usb-c port was the bigger deal for me.', 'I think a few   https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/s/mpyptn2U9y', ""It's obvious OP has an iPhone if he actually thinks Google isn't already doing this with Assistant on Android."
109,"All of these fancy photo editing features like magic erasers that Google advertises for their pixel phones are literally AI doing everyday tasks"", 'To be fair."
110,"This is the main reason to have bought apple in the past 20 years and has been shown to be a successful reason.', ""Don't forget that op prolly bought apple stock at 195 and now wants us to get in."", '""I\'m already an Apple fanboi and shareholder, heavily biased, stopping by fishing for confirmation from the peanut gallery.""', 'üòÜ', 'Too bad company the company is historically overvalued', 'Gives people a reason to purchase an upgrade', 'Same way they always do; they sell millions and millions of new devices capable of handling the new processor-intensive capabilities.', 'Apple Intelligence features will only be available on iPhone 15 Pro and higher models."
111,"And my guess is they will use the AI excuse to increase the base price of the new iPhone.', ""I am also waiting for every other company to tell me how they're going to make money from AI."", 'Sell phones primarily."
112,Secondarily look for services that you can charge monthly for.
113,"I could definitely see a ‚Äúunlocked advanced ai‚Äù added to their iCloud service bundle next year.', 'People pay money for AI features', 'Sometimes making money is just *not losing money* to provide a feature that everyone expects just so you can keep selling products to them."
114,"Ignoring privacy concerns, doing everything cloud side is more expensive and so far users do not pay enough to even cover the operating costs."
115,On-device generative AI is the most efficient way to deploy it.
116,There is more compute power in Apple devices owned by its ~1 billion users than in all the data centers of the world.
117,"Each device also contains all of the user\'s data, so doing things (training, inferencing) on-device has an operating cost to Apple of $0."
118,"Apple has been leveraging its customer-owned ""fleet"" of compute power for a long time, for example all Photos analytics are done on a user\'s devices with results synchronized securely between them.', 'Apple devices have a large number of apps and services that are developed and maintained by Apple for free for their users."
119,"It seems pretty obvious why.', 'Ai will only work on iPhone 15 pro and newer  I‚Äôm sure that will sell a few phones', ""1."
120,Put the most advanced ai features in new phones only 2.
121,Charge too much for those phones 3.
122,Advertise them 4.
123,Profit   It's the same thing they've always done.
124,"I will never buy an apple product but I love their stock."", '[deleted]', 'Up 1600% in the last decade !', ""or Windows."
125,"Co-pilot is getting it's own key on new windows computers."", 'Apple is still a major hw company - thy make money by convincing people that their hw is the best with the best ecosystem."
126,"Iphone sales will go up with the 16 as many people actually see a purpose of upgrading.', 'As most of it is on device they will not need additional servers."
127,So they will not lose money.
128,Just like most of their other software today.
129,One of the current limitations of running a model is ram.
130,"So Apple can increase ram every year to be able to run new and improved models.\xa0  Running on device will also degrade battery faster so now you also have lazy consumers buying new iterations instead of replacing the battery.\xa0  So to summarize: you will need better hardware to run AI.', 'You say shitty, I say potentially transformative.', 'I love listening to music.', ""I'm sure they'll let you disable that feature via MDM, at least for corporate provided cell phones."", ""Meanwhile, he's capitulated to handing over essentially unlimited PII driver data to the Chinese gov't in return for concessions on Tesla sales within the country."
131,How long before we find out that deal secretly includes non-Chinese driver data?
132,"Human garbage."", ""Regardless of what they are thinking, I can't help think of this good for OpenAI and Microsoft in general."
133,A rising tide and all that.
134,Black and white walling off in a growing space is less useful than a chaotic well-meaning competitive-free for all.
135,"It's also probably pretty good for NVDA."", 'That‚Äôs okay."
136,"I don‚Äôt care as long as they‚Äôre making money.', 'Exactly this."
137,"Is the new Apple Upgrade cycle going to be a ""must have"" for consumers?"
138,I doubt it.
139,Lots of flash without much practical improvements that will push someone to spend $$$ on that newest phone.
140,Apple clearly way behind on AI.
141,Don\'t get fooled at all.
142,"I would put them a distant 4th among Big Tech (MSFT & GOOG first, META, than AAPL/AMZN)', ""Are you kidding?"
143,Everyone wants Siri to work better.
144,"This lets Siri work better, which everyone is asking for."
145,"Massive W because Apple is looking at this from a solution based space rather that the here you go tools that do cool things, it's more let's make the phone do what it does much better to start off with."", ""haha, oh wow dude."
146,you should spend 20 minutes on the internet learning about AI and where it's at.
147,10 years?
148,LMFAO.
149,"Ironically two different AI models give us roughly 30% chance of avoiding the existential threat of AI in the next 20 years at our current trajectory."", 'Do you not know what is P/E ratio?', 'their growth is not on a negative trend, why do people keep repeating this', 'How you doing man?', 'Stock is AAPL, trying getting the symbol right."
150,"Oh yeah the stock is up 6% against the market today, just proof the stock market is not totally efficient.', 'Apple is not the stock to trade."
151,"You buy and hold it.', 'LOL', '[deleted]', ""Not really."
152,"They basically admitted that they don't have a competitive LLM, by the fact that they are relying on ChatGPT for the most advanced queries."
153,Apple is woefully behind.
154,Having to approve each time your query to ChatGPT is also an amazing user experience.
155,"/s"", 'Yeah, they are so innovative."
156,"Nobody could have guessed chat gpt comes to iphone!', 'Do you feel that AI features are that significant to you?"
157,"I‚Äôm still rocking an 11PM, keeping it until I really think it‚Äôs too sluggish for me to use."
158,I‚Äôve survived without the new AI features they‚Äôre going to have this long.
159,"I think I‚Äôll be ok with out.', 'Pretty sure only 15 pro and newer, seems like a scheme to get people to upgrade to a newer phone for AI features', ""I think they want people to buy new phones not give them AI on the old phones so they aren't as likely to buy a new one."", ""Yeah."
160,"But, I'm holding a modest leveraged position now and I'm wondering how much of the selloff is the Street worrying about Apple's short-term path towards monetizing AI."
161,It looks like a ChatGPT4o subscription is integrated for free.
162,"It looks like they're not adding AI as a service, so restricting devices is one way to encourage delayed upgrades to juice revenue."
163,"I do think that it's safe to buy-and-hold Apple shares for the long term, and I have a modest position there too, because it will hold up better in a market correction than chip stocks."
164,"Software stocks have a crazy valuation right now with only modest revenue/earnings growth, at best."
165,"So, at least part of the market is really stretched."", 'For Ai specific features the list is a lot shorter   https://www.macworld.com/article/2360280/ai-apple-intelligence-features-iphone-ipad-mac-hardware-requirements.html', ""I have a Pixel."

167,Does in 2 seconds what used to take me a bit to do in photoshop.
168,"pretty cool"", 'yup, they got branding nailed down."
169,"phone sales declining though, the overpriced goggles failed, they bailed on cars."
170,"it seems they are really searching for relevancy', ""That's a short term plan that's only gonna take them so far in a mature industry"", 'local AI ?"
171,"their competitors might offer better cloud-based versions cheaper', ""I honestly don't think the average consumer wants AI in their everyday life nearly as much as the investing world seems to think that they do."", ""Similar shtick to Microsoft's Co-Pilot**+** on the new Qualcomm-powered Win 11 devices."
172,A new feature driving adoption of a new generation of hardware.
173,Tale as old as time.
174,"Let's be clear: this is just keeping up with the pack in mobile, person-facing AI."
175,"It's not positioning them in any way to ride the AI wave - it just keeps them from being drowned by it."", 'My company pays for thousands of developers to have access to github copilot."
176,"And once office copilot is out in general use, it will create a pretty decent moat that keeps us from using other office products."
177,Not having AI in your software pretty soon will be like shipping your software on CD.
178,"No one is going to want that shit.', ""The best AI applications are business to business."
179,It can solve certain problems really well.
180,"Direct to consumer where everyone expects tech for free (by being the product) these days, I don't see how it gets monetized effectively."", 'By pumping their stock', ""Ok, I would really like to know how free apps/services developed by Apple translates into money."
181,Sounds like they are spending money and not making any money back.
182,"Unless their offerings are so much better than google that it convinces people to dump Android for good, I just don't see it happening."
183,"If these phones cost $1500+ I could see it having the reverse effect where people who are more budget conscious start ditching Apple or hold onto their old iPhones because they are priced out of the market for new iPhones."", ""weren't you surprised new phone wasn't announced with AI"", 'Apple‚Äôs pitch is they will not use your data for corporate purposes, it will be private.', 'Maybe watch the keynote?', ""It can go up, but there's no way it will go up enough to justify the current valuation."
184,"P/E of 30 means massive growth over the coming years."", ""If it is run on system, it can only be run on phones with neural engines built in, as these LLMs are power consuming machines."
185,"You wouldn't get anything close to GPT level, more likely to be close to a good chatbot."
186,"Running natively has massive limitations, even on pretty good devices."
187,You're also disregarding the absolutely massive R&D expenses that go into LLM development.
188,"That alone would be billions of dollars."", 'I\'m not a *spits in disgust* investor, so I wouldn\'t know  I\'m just a software developer who finds the ""AI"" craze hilarious and depressing simultaneously  But yeah a text and image generator in iOS is really gonna be ""transformative"" lmfao', ""Apple's getting better at playing in the corporate world, esp."
189,in regulated industries.
190,"Privacy is critical, but they need to cross that threshold where they realize corporate-issued phones for medical, govt., banking, etc."

192,I think most of Apple Intelligence is on Apple hardware.
193,"We will see how much functionality is based on ChatGPT', '->2% on the day with probably another -5 - -10% by EoW."
194,I think the general sentiment agreed with you/s   That‚Äôs it?
195,Siri regurgitating information found on the internet a little faster and some more slight nuance?
196,That‚Äôs your golden goose egg?
197,Again practical & productive features that the general populace would view as ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù is years away.
198,"No revenue, much less profit."

204,"Obviously that‚Äôs a convenient reason to tell people they have to upgrade, but it‚Äôs a compelling argument.', ""I think once there's widespread consumer reviews of how it actually functions on their new phones, that will create the buying pressure to upgrade old phones that has stagnated for apple the past few years."
205,The past few years there's been basically just small-medium spec improvements without any real need for it (cool the processor is faster but my iphone 12/13 is doing 95% of my use cases just fine).
206,I'd argue this is the first time in ~4 years that there's a step forward in iphone functionality that is meaningfully large to get people to upgrade.
207,"All comes down to the gap between the presentation's demos and actual usability."", ""the problem is they've broken a lot of trust by leaving siri as a pile of shit for so long while promising over and over to make it better."
208,"not a chance I'm dropping money on yet another promise that siri will stop sucking."", ""> seems like a scheme to get people to upgrade to a newer phone for AI features  This is going to back fire, at least in some regards imo."
209,I'm not buying a new phone just for what I find is mostly gimmicky AI.
210,I can't be the only one who thinks this or even close to it.
211,"If anything, this makes me just want to hold onto my 13 Pro even longer."", ""I have owned apple stock for 20 years now (stupidly sold some of it long time ago sadly)."
212,I don't think they need to search for relevancy.
213,They are relevant.
214,They are the montblanc of tech.
215,The LV of tech.
216,Luxury standing right at the unaffordable line.
217,"Until people stop being apple fanboys, I won't sell."", 'selling 1 billion iphones per 900usd each sounds like good enough plan for short term..', 'That‚Äôs the point, this‚Äôll buy them a few more years to find something else to drive sales."
218,"As it were the main concern with apple was lack of innovation now they ‚Äúinnovated‚Äù again so more iPhones will be bought due to hype.', 'Yes, for Apple‚Äôs AI both the requests and the AI responses remain on the device."
219,"One of Apple‚Äôs key selling points is privacy, and this is central to that."
220,It may be that customers don‚Äôt care that much; we‚Äôll see.
221,"ChatGPT will also be available at the system level at no charge, so those willing to sacrifice privacy for the familiarity of ChatGPT will have that option.', ""they might not at first.."

228,It‚Äôs been around for free for over a decade and received regular free updates.
229,It‚Äôs been a draw towards the iPhone and an example of their walled garden / ecosystem.
230,They‚Äôve spent a considerable amount of money on iMessage because it makes the iPhone (and the Apple ecosystem) a better value proposition.
231,"Other great examples include FaceTime and Find My.', ""Part of Apple's business model has and will continue to be, Pay more for our electronic devices and we won't monetize your data."
232,Google's business model is pay less for these things and we'll make our money using your data.
233,"No 2 businesses are more complimentary than Google and Apple, while appearing to be fiercely competitive."
234,"They literally take the entire world, separate them into 2 groups, extract the maximum amount of value from these two groups, and rarely do they have to compete for each other's group to the point they sacrifice profits."", ""Yes agreed the capabilities will not be comparable to a big >70B parameter LLM."
235,However the model can improve if the hardware improves.\xa0 But even if you get a bigger model some tasks on device are better suited for smaller models which have lower latency for inference.
236,Asking a 70B model for a simple action may take orders of magnitude longer than asking a 13B parameter model to perform the same action.
237,It all depends on what you want to achieve.
238,"I don't think Apple Intelligence is striving to be an LLM in the limit."", ""except apple doesn't use nvda"", ""they weren't really clear on the server portion."
239,"Most calls are local, but they do offload some to their own cloud, and offer integration with OpenAI."
240,"They never said what their cloud server run on, and they don't control the OpenAI servers."", ""How's that share price prediction going?"
241,"LMAO."", 'This gets funnier every day.', ""[Shows what you know, lol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/6ZzI0EkIp7)  I wouldn't trust you to predict the future cash flows of a banana peel."", ""I've watched countless hours of the leading AI and engineering experts talk about it."
242,"Suggest you start with at least a Sesame Street intro course to AI before making your bold predictions."", 'They had a massive revenue spike during the pandemic."
243,"This is so obviously not long term decline.', ""They are using SLMs."
244,Small models.
245,"These are very primitive models, they are just specialized for those tasks you outlined."
246,ChatGPT is much more sophisticated.
247,Almost anyone can make an SLM at this point.
248,"Ask your self, why would Apple use ChatGPT if their models were better?"
249,Stop being a fanboy and think rationally.
250,Also what about iPhone 15 not being able to use this service?
251,Didn't that phone come out like 8 months ago.
252,"This is a disaster."", 'Yeah absolutely."
253,To each their own.
254,I used to be crazy about having the latest phone but I‚Äôve gotten to a point where I know my use and for me personally my 11PM can do exactly what a 15PM needs to do for me.
255,"I do agree that the AI looks pretty cool and I‚Äôm looking forward to having an iPhone with that at some post on the future', ""Apple might have one of the strongest track records of delivering usability from demos iRL (given some time) and making it cool in the process."
256,"iPads, iWatches, and iPods are ubiquitous and trend-setting, but they have taken years to catch on."
257,"If they can pull this off and improve the UX on the Vision Pro in the next few years, I think Apple could usher in the next generation of computing with implications I'm not quite sure we are ready for at all."", 'You don‚Äôt understand the Apple‚Äôs customer base then.', ""I agree with you on half of that, yup."
258,I think the company is searching for a new product which is better term than relevance.
259,"I do agree with you though, they can coast on their brand."
260,I don't think you'll ever get rid of fanboys.
261,People can't just switch phone or computer brands once you're institutionalized.
262,"I'd make fun of apple users for how dumbed down the instruments are, but when I got an iPhone for work it was like learning everything all over again for the features."
263,"Never liked Apple as a PC guy, but they have a great user experience which entrenches users to stay with them."
264,"Sales declining in China, but there are a couple generations of Westerners I don't ever see switching."", 'Users care, but not that much for privacy."
265,"The key thing is, AI is inherently centralizing and needs to be offloaded to the cloud to be smart (i.e."
266,time-saving) enough.
267,"Running AI models (even small) on device is very energy consuming, so i think eventually phones will become dumb terminals to our cloud-based AI persona."
268,"Apps are mostly not going to be needed, because a generative AI is basically writing an app every time it responds.', ""Also a lot of people didn't think they needed 3DTVs, smart glasses, or the metaverse."
269,"And they were right."", ""If Google offers the same services on Android it's going to be a wash."
270,"It could even hurt Apple if their strategy of on device AI processing inflates the cost of iPhones and makes their AI worse than Google who is going with a cloud AI first strategy."", '‚ÄúChatGPT, seamlessly integrated."
271,"With ChatGPT from OpenAI integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, you get even more expertise when it might be helpful for you ‚Äî no need to jump between tools."
272,"Siri can tap into ChatGPT for certain requests, including questions about photos or documents."
273,"And with Compose in Writing Tools, you can create and illustrate original content from scratch."
274,You control when ChatGPT is used and will be asked before any of your information is shared.
275,"Anyone can access ChatGPT for free, without creating an account."
276,ChatGPT subscribers can connect accounts to access paid features within these experiences.‚Äù  https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/  How is this not a huge win for MSFT.
277,Only way it‚Äôs not is if Apple relies less and less on ChatGPT in the future.
278,"But right now it sounds like a lot of stuff will be router there', 'Apple up on a partnership with Affirm to further increase the already dramatically increasing household debt values‚Ä¶ That shows that demand is even worse than originally thought."
279,That some people are going to take on loans to buy an Apple product.
280,"I guess not terrible for Apple in the short term, but extremely bearish news for the market/economy as a whole which will still affect Apple.', 'Indeed."
281,Let‚Äôs see how it goes.
282,"Even the most optimistic of people know that a 10% increase in Apple is outrageous.', 'Considering a banana peel is incapable of generating cash flow‚Ä¶ I think my statements carry a bit more weight than yours.', 'he‚Äôs Just another guy with negative returns trying to short the market LOL."
283,"Looks in the mirror everyday and says ‚Äúthe market is wrong, Im right‚Äú', 'correct but this is Apple, not zoom, so expectations are high."
284,"So having a 2 year decline is hard to stomach', ""where did I say that their models are better than ChatGPT?"
285,"I said: they have access to data that ChatGPT won't have access to  ChatGPT can be a super human intelligence but if it doesn't know what you wrote to your mom yesterday it can't tell you anything about it"", 'I am the Apple customer base."
286,All of my devices are Apple.
287,Go check out /r/Apple.
288,"I‚Äôm not the only one done with Siri.', 'False equivalency, dude.', 'Google can‚Äôt currently offer comparable user experiences with other free services like iMessage, Find My, or on-device AI for a variety of reasons."
289,"Regarding on-device, I suspect the use of AI will be pretty conservative."
290,"Smaller models are ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for simple use cases, and nothing in the keynote today indicated they‚Äôd be turning Siri into a chat bot like Claude or ChatGPT.\xa0  Running the big models in the cloud is also very expensive."
291,"Running things on device would mean big cost savings for Apple.\xa0  The whole AI race is still pretty early though, so it‚Äôs certainly possible Apple will end up screwed here.', 'Watch the video."
292,Almost none of your requests will go to ChatGPT.
293,"That integration is basically a fall back for general knowledge queries, not for personal assistant requests."
294,"Plus it can be replaced by any other AI that wants to integrate.', ""Straight copium - you don't understand what really drives markets."
295,"Enjoy lagging the index."", 'No - we thought it at 170 was outrageous."
296,"Your poor portfolio :(', ""Lol, you turned down an easy double on the second largest company in the world."
297,"Actually, you say fair value is oct 2022 which is a 10x - why didn't you just buy it in October then?"
298,"<-- hence your inability to price future cash flows, you wouldn't be whining if you had any clue, you be sitting on 1,000%+ gains like the rest of us."
299,"Sucks to miss generational gains, but you only have yourself to blame."
300,If only you had the humility to learn from it...
301,"Like, you're literally saying NVDA should be valued at 2x their earnings...."
302,for a company that just 10x earnings in a few years.
303,You just missed it and have done mental gymnastics to live in a world where you're still right and it's the markets who are wrong.
304,"Sad."", 'And all the silent downvotes from similar people."
305,I love it.
306,I said buy NVDA for easy gains 8 months ago and got the same down votes.
307,Absolute losers incapable of putting ego aside to learn.
308,"Never get your second comma that way folks.', 'What is the point of this conversation?', 'Yup, Siri is an idiot in dire need of an AI boost.', 'Searching for knowledge is something people have used Google for this is still a very big deal', 'Damn your portfolio must be in the dumper üòÇüòÇ Can‚Äôt wait to see that -75% loss post soon.', ""Pretty simple, Apple can offer a personalized version of GPT based on what you do on your phone and other Apple devices."
309,That's pretty unique to Apple.
310,"Although this isn't a significant AI leap or program, and it uses primitive models, it's still a large jump for the normal Apple user, which is the majority of Americans."
311,"Kinda a big deal."", '[removed]', 'Chargpt is doing the writing and anything really hard."
312,"I have tried to ask Siri all kind of questions and realized it doesn‚Äôt really know anything this is going to be amazing just like ChatGPT is.', ""If only your logic made any sense?"
313,"I'm rolling in it bud ü§£"", '![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)', 'Not sure how relevant that is with the fact that Apple is woefully behind in AI."
314,Though.
315,They sprinkled some SLMs throughout the app ecosystem but you still have to use ChatGPT for anything more advanced.
316,Like how am I wrong for stating the obvious.
317,Apple got caught with their pants down.
318,"They had no AI strategy they are just starting now.', ""By stating how obviously behind Apple is."
319,The only large infrastructure company with no LLM of their own?
320,"You seem to be a fanboy who's scared of the truth."", 'Apple Intelligence is going to handle the writing (text generation)."
321,Apple Intelligence is not the same as Siri..
322,"although they will be integrated.', 'How did Apple develop this do you think it will be any good compared to ChatGPT to me that‚Äôs kind of disappointing as I doubt it will be as good', 'Quote I pasted above says ChatGPT is integrated into writing tools‚Ä¶', ""I expect it to be much worse than ChatGPT at general knowledge stuff, but since it has access to all your private information, Apple's engine will probably be great at what its used for."", ""right."
323,its bad wording.
324,ChatGPT (and all the plugged in engines) are integrated in all the same places as Apple's - including most system text fields.
325,It just won't be called by default.
326,"You have to ask for it specifically."", 'As long as I can say hey siri ask ChatGPT the history of Malibu California I‚Äôm good but it would have been better if it could just know when it needs to go there and do it without asking me every time."
327,"Are you sure this is how it works?', 'Not sure if you can ask to go directly to chatGpt when you ask the question."
328,If Apple doesn‚Äôt have a good answer it will ask if you want to try chatGpt.
329,It‚Äôs a warning because it‚Äôs less secure.']
330,['It‚Äôs just a mature company now.
331,"Slow or low growth.', 'They have 90ish percent of the teen/young adult market."
332,"That likely means lifelong Apple users, who will give their kids Apple products."
333,"Not sure how much more room to grow they have, but I‚Äôm not worried about the stock.', ""1."
334,The Vision Pro is a dev kit.
335,Apple's end game here are wearable glasses with the same functionality as Vision Pro but indistinguishable from normal sunglasses.
336,It's only then that we'll see how much value there is in this new product line.
337,2.
338,Almost 90% of Gen Z in the US owns an iPhone.
339,The iPhone isn't going anywhere.
340,3.
341,Services revenue the past quarter was $23.9B in total and $700M higher than estimated.
342,How much growth do you want?
343,4.
344,Such a major buyback (biggest in history) can only mean one thing: Apple's confidence in its own roadmap and future growth.
345,5.
346,China growth might be slowing down but other emerging markets such as India are just starting to take off.
347,6.
348,No telling how many new products/product lines are on the road map.
349,"I can think of a few major releases: Apple watch with glucose monitor, Apple glasses or/and much more lightweight Vision Pro successor, and of course..."
350,AI products/services.
351,"Plenty of next big things!"", ""You listed valid points but I still wouldn't bet against Tim Apple."", 'They invest enormously in RnD', 'If Reddit is telling me to sell Apple I guess it‚Äôs time to load up', 'Warren Buffett seems to think it‚Äôs ok."
352,"He looks like he knows what he‚Äôs doing', 'I unloaded my Apple a few months back."
353,I still think it‚Äôs a great investment and have decent exposure to it in ETFs.
354,However I agree with your points.
355,"I think Apple is in a maturation era, similar to Microsoft from 2008-2020."
356,"It will grow but not as extremely, and will continue to maintain pace."
357,"I‚Äôm sure in 10 years, once AI is further along, Apple will drop the next amazing item and shoot back up again."
358,In the meantime I still hold my Microsoft shares.
359,"I think Microsoft is going to do big things in the next ten years as the leading corporate computer software company in USA.', ""No I'm not worried."
360,Is a growth stock longterm?
361,No.
362,Will it keep buying back stock and increasing its div?
363,Oracle of omaha still likes it in the mid long term.
364,So I'm still in.
365,"Yes Microsoft looks like a better growth potential so buy both."", 'Microsoft can‚Äôt even fix their gaming division!!!"
366,Not worried about the buyback.
367,Apple can buy companies at will.
368,They bought Beats a company that makes shit product and turned it into gold.
369,"I hope they buy paramount.', 'Not really."
370,The installed base of users and the amount of the world that aspires to be an Apple product user is not going away that I can see.
371,And they love rewarding their stock holders.
372,I own a massive position.
373,But I also hedge it with puts as insurance.
374,"I sleep well', ""While other big tech companies are raising capex to invest in AI infrastructure, Apple is buying back stock at a historical rate."
375,"It's nice to raise EPS, but it also signals Apple has nothing better to do than buy back stock."", 'The Apple Vis√≥n Pro is not a dud."
376,"Apple never said they would sell ‚Äú800,000‚Äù units, they don‚Äôt even have enough OLED screens to make that many at the moment."
377,If anything they have sold more than expected.
378,As a AVP owner it‚Äôs clear to me that this is the future of computing and once it‚Äôs more affordable it‚Äôs going to be mainstream.
379,"Therefore I‚Äôve invested more in Apple', 'I‚Äôve been thinking this myself lately looking at their middling performance over the last few months."
380,I think it‚Äôs a fine hold but I‚Äôm not sure we can expect growth in line with the 2010s.
381,I‚Äôm not adding more.
382,"Apple remains the most influential consumer hardware tech company out there, but a lot of their growth is baked in on short and medium terms I think."
383,I also wonder about the future of hardware generally in the age of the cloud and software as a service.
384,"Will people still be buying hardware with local compute, or will we all be using glorified web browsers in the future for everything down to the OS?', 'Not worried."
385,"I‚Äôll be interested to see what happens when they buy Rivian.', 'All they need to say is the magic words ""AI"" and that will be said in June.', 'Apple is mature business."
386,They don‚Äôt have to grow.
387,They are an enormous subscription cash machine essentially.
388,This is what funds their buybacks.
389,And it is a good stock because of those buybacks.
390,"They would have to start shrinking for it to be a bad stock.', ""They just have to come up with a new outdated technology to beautify and they'll be fine"", 'Jony Ive left Apple."
391,He was the last great vestige of the Steve Jobs era.
392,Ive wrote the design language for Apple products since the late 90‚Äôs.
393,"I‚Äôve even noticed a downward trend in Apple software, such as the iPhone keyboard not being as touch-accurate as it once was."
394,Steve Jobs would have never let glaring bugs like that into production software.
395,"I‚Äôve been an Apple user since 1992, so I‚Äôve seen a thing or two.', 'No', 'The report of pullback for Vision Pro was based off one person."
396,"It‚Äôs not real', 'Nope', ""Why should I be worried, if the stock gets down low again he'll pump in billions to keep it up."
397,"They do it every year"", 'I‚Äôve definitely been worried about Apple."
398,I was going to sell half of my shares.
399,But It‚Äôs gone up $10 a share in the last month or so.
400,I think there were two reasons.
401,One of course is the buy back and the other is the chip they are putting in the iPad Pro.
402,In reality since the chip cannot be used with the laptop etc it‚Äôs got a long way to go.
403,"But definitely when they do develop their AI chip that will work well in all Apple products, it will be a game changer."
404,I want to be around for that.
405,I still wonder if I should start selling it.
406,"Apple my largest investment right now.', 'Bro really thinks Apple is going to crumble."
407,"Just look around you and you should have your answer.', ""I'm turning it down in my portfolio a bit because there hasn't been a lot of breakout growth indicators for years now, but its going to be a very safe investment."
408,They also sit on piles of cash that could be deployed to something innovative.
409,"They cancelled the Apple Car, but that seems like a net positive, it was probably a huge money hole that would've been a boondoggle for them and their brand."
410,"Still waiting for them to have their modern Microsoft era, where they go all-in on their developers and pushing Apple cloud resources."
411,"It hasn't happened and I don't see any indicators of that happening, but all the pieces are there for them to capitalize on it."
412,"They still remain focused on consumer products and that's doing really well for them."", 'They should buy tik tok', ""I dont' understand why apple have such high valuation."
413,"That being said, the same can be said about coco cola."
414,"Probably warren buffet buys it, and people think it should have high valuation because it have good moat, so relatively safe."", 'AI is going to transform the next iPhone upgrade ‚Äî and drive sales through the roof.', 'I think when it comes to chips (for LLM/AI) Apple is long."
415,"Right now, cloud providers are in a race to provide LLM services on the cloud - but Apple I think will have an edge on the _edge_ in the future."
416,"They would be positioned to provide LLM/AI services right on the device without network connections and with their focus on privacy it seems that strategy would be a good fit.', 'In 2007 the media was full of stories about how the iPhone was huge and heavy and slow and way too expensive, and couldn‚Äôt possibly compete with industry leaders like BlackBerry and Nokia.', 'Never bet against Tim apple', 'You forgot to mention that Warren Buffett just [sold a boatload](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/warren-buffett-just-sold-more-than-100-million-shares-of-apple-reason-why-is-eye-opening.html) of Apple stock', ""I don't think Apple is doomed but at the same time I sold most of my shares"", 'I am a long term Apple user but I am a bit concerned about them long term."
417,It‚Äôs just hard to see how they continue to grow from here.
418,The run up the last 25 years was pretty incredible though.
419,I‚Äôm holding but not adding to a relatively small position in my portfolio.
420,"On the other hand, I‚Äôm actually buying some Berkshire (mostly for tax purposes to avoid dividends and get a bit of diversification).', 'Yes innovation for iPhones has stalled', 'If anyone was worried about AAPL in the long term, the price would have already dropped significantly."
421,"In short, no one is worried about AAPL in the long term.', 'The fact they are unable to make any solid decision and move in the last five years while every other tech giant is double digit growth is concerning', 'I think its not going anywhere."
422,But it might grow at a slower pace.
423,"Still good tho', 'You guys keep talking about how Apple is not inventing anything new."
424,BUT THEY DID yesterday!
425,It‚Äôs an AI focused chip for the updated iPad Pro!!
426,"Nvda took a pretty big dive when the news came out & Apple opened at $184, the highest in a while.', 'I‚Äôm concerned about growth but not them making a fuck ton of money(they will always do that)  Growth moves the stock so I guess yea?', 'You forgot something very important."
427,"The anti-trust sharks are circling them along with Google and Amazon.', 'Not even a little.', 'No.', 'Remember the GUH guy?"
428,"There‚Äôs your answer', ""Long term absolutely not."
429,"Short term, yes slightly."
430,Vision pro is just getting started.
431,"If the tech improves and it can be used on a daily basis, it'll be a hit."
432,"It doesn't need iPhone level adoption, it's an extension to the iPhone and macbook."
433,It's already sold well for a new production.
434,iPhone sales being down is a short term problem not long term.
435,"They have reached market saturation and now the product is here to stay, it will always bring in large revenue, but it's not going to always get bigger and bigger any more."
436,"Apple are definitely investing shit loads into R&D, buy backs are temporary and a way to take back more control of the company."
437,"They always do buybacks as well as invest in the business, they have more money than most."
438,"I feel like everything you brought up is short term, not long term."
439,"We have no idea what Apple has got behind the scenes, they might still be working on the car in a smaller way, or something completely brand new."", 'The absolutely worst case is that AAPL becomes the MSFT 2000s stock."
440,It doesn‚Äôt move upward but it also doesn‚Äôt move downward.
441,"It‚Äôs called cash.', ""I think it's also worth mentioning:  7\\."
442,"If government (EU or US) antitrust actions force Google to stop paying others to favor their search engine, Apple loses $20B of pure profit every year."", ""If you worry about Apple, what's left for the rest of the companies?"", 'AAPL thrives on the new technologies, does not matter if they are first to adopt it or not, because they know how to make the tech easy to use (available) for general population."
443,"Generative AI for example is an amazing new technology, but it didn‚Äôt affect life of most of the population in any way."
444,"And AAPL could potentially come up with something that would be usable by everyone and revolutionize the world.', 'Can not lie when we say the cell phone market is now a mature industry."
445,The turn rate for cell phones is much slower and the competition is much greater.
446,"The characterization of APPLE might be from a GREAT INVESTMENT to a GOOD INVEST.', ""Nah, they will just use their cash to buy back more stock."
447,Is it an issue for super long term?
448,"Yup, don't care, will be dead by then I guess"", 'Could have said the same thing 5+ years ago when the stock was $60', 'No."
449,But it is not a growth stick.
450,"Has matured into a high cash flow, high earning, dividend giving stock."
451,Their products come in cycles with almost too much hype and the doom and gloom.
452,They still have an amazing ecosystem.
453,I am particularly excited about their focus on AI.
454,They have a major headstart with on-device AI chipset.
455,Imagine a Siri 2.0 that truly leveraged AI model and could even be autonomous agent.
456,That could be transformative for Apple and spur upgrade cycle.
457,My one criticism of Apple is their iverly cautious growth mentality.
458,They never make big acquisitions or take bolder moves.
459,You could argue that has been a cornerstone of their success but they also create much more cash than they did before.
460,"For instance, they could have acquired an EV like Rivian instead of sinking billions internally only to kill the project."
461,"Or, with all their advancements with Silicon lately (arguably outperforming intel/amd), they could lean into that and truly take on the likes of Nvidia with a specific focus on graphics and AI."
462,Apple should own the graphics chipset market with their base of creators.
463,That would be a huge TAM.
464,"While not growth oriented, still a very healthy cash cow long term.', 'Nope', 'I am not , as as even with iPhone struggles it  recorded $383 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2023 and earned nearly $97 billion in net income."
465,As long as it profitable I have no concerns long.
466,I expect over 5 years to be in 10-15% return category.
467,"I did buy more before the buyback as I felt is over sold.', 'Yeah."
468,"Despite the substantial moat at this time, tech moves quickly and they really haven‚Äôt produced a truly innovative product since the Apple Watch."
469,"The new iPhones aren‚Äôt anything special (slightly better processor, better camera) but not that quantum leap we saw when they introduced the iPhone.', 'Buybacks aren‚Äôt the issue."
470,The issue is they‚Äôre incinerating money with these expensive buybacks.
471,"Inherently you want mature companies to engage in return to shareholder.', ""They shifted production out of China about two years too late."
472,"It's going to take a few years to rebuild that supply chain.\xa0   I wouldn't sell, but I definitely would average down."", 'What ever happened with Apple financial services?"
473,"Is that scrapped now?', ""AAPL is now moving to services just like Microsoft has been doing with their Office and Windows products for decades."
474,They are looking at long term market share nowadays rather than just new products all the time.
475,"As long as they can keep their customers' minds away from Android or all other alternatives, AAPL will stay around."", 'To fly the way they have in the past they need to develop something new.', 'Not at all."
476,I have a lot of trust in AAPL and less in Microsoft.
477,"Look how Microsoft has treated gaming, cell phones, etc."
478,All of Apples products are hits eventually.
479,"There are more markets to break into and the integration of AI.', 'I think as the china/usa trade war continues those china sales are going to come down dramatically because they will/are pushing people towards china brands, and the china market is HUGE, next i think is an issue with innovation, they just do spec bumps year after year, and the prices are too HIGH, and people arnt willing to pay for nothing nowadays."
480,"I think they can innovate and come out with new products that will bring in revenue, but its a matter of what will they bring to the table, and we dont know.', 'Let Tim Cook!', 'Cell phones  Apple current  60% US market share."
481,20% Non US market share.
482,"Blackberry  20% global peak  50% USA peak  Anything is possible', 'No."
483,Apple doesn‚Äôt lose.
484,"Apple always wins eventually*', 'Just came here to say that AAPL is investing into R&D more than they ever did."
485,AAPL cash flow is consistently increasing on a quarterly basis.
486,"They‚Äôre constantly reinvesting in R&D‚Äôs and buybacks.', 'No."
487,Apple does not even need to create or innovate anything really.
488,They can literally let competitors create a new product or innovate and create that same product with an Apple logo.
489,"And people will always choose the Apple brand over other products', 'Apple is an easy hold long term."
490,"They are still by far the most premium technology company in the world.', ""I think a real next generation of technology is around the corner and Apple will lead the market, even if mainly by means of marketing as we all know they don't offer any real new tech themselves aside from a few exceptions."", 'Am I worried about a company among the top successful on the entire planet?"
491,"Not particularly.', ""What I'd be most worried about for Apple is the potential for some new technology to come around that disrupts their smartphone dominance."
492,"Their products are in a wide acceptance use, so the only place they can really go with their current products is down."
493,"They don't have anything in the pipelines that can actually drive the company the way the iPhone did, which means low growth, and the potential for heavy disruption in the future"", 'PE ratio is at 28 and that will decline with all their buybacks."
494,"So a mature company with a low 20 PE and a ton of cash is still a good investment in my opinion.', 'Great company fundamentals, lacks innovation, has big cash cows  Shitty for a multi trillion dollar stock*, but no, not a bad company', ""I'm not."
495,"I feel that people are buying them less because they last longer, I'm still on an 11."
496,"Pretty much everyone I know has an iPhone and they have said they won't get another one, we're all locked into the system and we don't want to start over."", 'There blue chip stock now', 'The buyback is probably since they have lots of cash reserves and can‚Äôt buy anyone out in the current market so might be the best move', 'Apple has never spent a lot of money on R&D compared to the competition."
497,"They have ""few"" parents."
498,"Maybe they should consider moving into other electronics, such as TVs, speakers etc."
499,"Or maybe the enterprise market with CPU\'s?', 'Their innovation seems to come in waves."
500,"It will be boring for a decade and then they will release their retina implant and everyone on earth will line up to have it installed in their face.', ""Every Sci-Fi movie or TV show about the future has people still using iPads."
501,"Worry if they become a Kodak and DON'T embrace new tech categories."", 'yeah, your bulletpoints are all probably not true', 'I am not."
502,I think the biggest risk in the shorter term is the government requiring a screen when you first turn on your iPhone that asks your preferred search engine.
503,"Google would still get their market share and Apple would loose the billions that Google pays them today to be default search.', ""India's growing middle class will keep AAPL growing for years to come."", 'Apple going to harness its data for something amazing.', ""Apple have something that no other company has, and that is the ecosystem."
504,"This means incredible ease of use for people that can't be arsed with multiple systems, and there are many of these people."
505,Most of these people also can't be arsed changing to other systems once Apple has a hold on them.
506,No other company comes anywhere close to the streamlined world Apple has created (for the meantime anyway).
507,I have had many 'normal' PCs and various Android devices.
508,Yeah I mean they all work ok but I don't have a 'connection' with any of these devices like I do with my Apple stuff.
509,"I am not trying to come over as some sort of tech-romantic but I genuinely 'like' using my Apple devices over others, the quality and user experience is genuinely unequalled."
510,I also think health might be a huge growth area for them.
511,"So I for one am not 'worried', but I am also not expecting mahoosive returns either."", 'Go to sleep wake up in 5 years for their humanoid bot', ""No."
512,"1) They have a cult following ready to by whatever iCrap they throw on the market year after year  2) They're sitting on a pile of cash with a fortress balance sheet  3) They're starting to dabble in AI  4) Buffet likes them and owns a bunch"", 'Apple sells amazing consumer products and services."
513,Apple sells the *same* consumer products and services they did 10 years ago.
514,"They are no longer a leader in any growth market like they were with iPod, iPhone and iPad."
515,"Their services revenue growth is not as robust as most would like to see, with physical device sales still accounting for 78% of their 2023 revenue."
516,"As others have noted, Apple\'s iPhone has a very strong cultural prevalence with some demographics, but their global market share has been roughly the same for 12 years."
517,"The replacement cycle for phones has been trending to less frequent for the last 4 years, which is one reason why we see the dip in iPhone revenue."
518,"No one should be viewing AAPL as a growth stock at this point - the impassioned following they enjoy gives them more ""blue chip"" stability, but even that could turn downward rapidly with looming geopolitical instability and the potential of sanctions, embargoes, etc."
519,"E.g., if China pulls the trigger on a Taiwan invasion, Apple - as a ""make and sell devices"" company will be disproportionately exposed."
520,Watching China gobble up gold should make anyone concerned that they (China) are hedging against very significant instability.
521,"So no, def."
522,not a growth stock.
523,"Not unless they can establish themselves as a leader in an untapped high growth market, whether that\'s some new hardware breakthrough or a runaway success with some a services offering.', 'No."
524,"There was rumors they may try to make a smart ring like the oura ring and I think that will be the next big thing.', 'Anyone considering the possibility that Apple partners with OpenAi?"
525,Essentially stealing them away from Microsoft?
526,If OpenAi was integrated into the Apple ecosystem that would likely propel them to the top of the mag 7 again.
527,"Their choices are Google or OpenAi from my pov', 'One more comment, if China invades Taiwan plenty of businesses will suffer, but Apple in particular will feel the pain.', 'They said they would do that massive buyback - has that already happened?', 'Just ‚Äúone more thing‚Äù."
528,"Guys, this is Apple."
529,"Sell all you want and there will be a time you will regret.', 'I‚Äôve been doing the opposite of anything this subredddit says and I‚Äôve been doing pretty great', ""I was pre- Vision pro but seeing their product line now, knowing they scrapped the car and seeing where their product line is maturing and how Apple's walled garden ecosystem functions currently reinvigorated my belief in them as a company."
530,"I'm bullish long term."", 'Yah', 'Also, Warren Buffet cashed out some of his gains ($40 billion)', 'they are in the late tech behemoth stage."
531,Similar to Oracle/IBM/Microsoft in the 00s.
532,"Too big to fail and disappear but clearly lacking that spark, and therefore on autopilot.', 'Not at all', 'Vision Pro is a product in its early lifecycle."
533,Look at how the iPhone was when first released.
534,"Yes it‚Äôs very clunky, but having it for two weeks, I see the future potential."
535,The key here will be glasses if they are able to.
536,"Technology always starts clunky and begins to get smaller over time.', 'Way behind in ai too."
537,"But remember they got a war chest like no other, so have ability to reinvent."
538,"Cook needs to go they need fresh leadership', 'No', 'I think it‚Äôs way early to say the VP is a dud."
539,It‚Äôs in its infancy and like the iPhone will grow.
540,"Having used one myself, the content that is there is otherworldly."
541,They‚Äôll figure out a more accessible model and release a bunch of apps within the next year.
542,Then it will get adopted em mass.
543,I‚Äôve taken some of my $ off the table but see this as their biggest product since the iPhone.
544,Just gonna take time.
545,They cancelled the car before launch.
546,VP is out.
547,"Will be a slow burn but it‚Äôll get there', ""yeah vision pro was popular for a month after it came out then no one talked about it after...does it really make that much to make that the price has to be that high?"
548,"If they reduced the price a lot and still profit, then why don't they...i would buy it for 700 bucks"", ""Apple Vision Pro was never going to be a massive needle mover, at least not right now (maybe in a few generations)."
549,"And I'm glad that they're getting out of the car industry, they can now divert all that R&D time & money into their bread butter: products, and now services."
550,"At the end of the day, I like Apple, and I'm going to be holding it."
551,Do I think that they'll be growing at the same pace that they have been the past 5-10 years?
552,"Do I think that they will continue to grow, albeit a steadier pace?"
553,"I'm going to continue to hold, but I'm also going to be trimming away some of my holdings."
554,"I think Microsoft is going to continue to grow at a faster pace than Apple as well."", ""I'm not worried about aapl long term, and although the points you made are valid, they aren't my top concerns."
555,My top concern is only seeing their moat/monopoly being weakened.
556,I don't like that europe is putting in laws to weaken the aapl ecosystem.
557,"While I hate how closed aapl products can be, that's what let's them be monopolistic."
558,"I don't like seeing that being weakened, how they have to open up their iTunes/apple store more etc."
559,"I think we will see slower growth, and for that, it mostly means that I will begin to move my dca to other companies who I think will grow more than aapl would."", 'I‚Äôm not ‚Äúworried‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt have an opinion or prediction about a fall."
560,"However, I won‚Äôt have direct exposure to AAPL for the simple fact that the entire revenue juggernaut anchors to mobile."
561,Wearables require phone.
562,Air pods require phone.
563,App Store revenue heavily pulls from phone ownership.
564,Health revenue ideas pull from wearables -> phone.
565,"If they lose dominance around the phone, the whole ecosystem evaporates.', ""They'll release the 16 and it'll pop off like usual."
566,"Trust in human sheep brain"", 'I am a little worried about this communication and positioning of their new iPads, and the possible underlying disconnect they have with the community."
567,"I‚Äôm a fan boy for life, but this move / communication feels so out of touch and insensitive to the realities of what people are feeling about AI right now."
568,"Seems so unlike Apple, or maybe not?"
569,It‚Äôs a long way from their attack on Big Brother IBM.
570,Now they are BB?
571,"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ipad-pro-ad-crush-tim-cook-ratioed-2024-5', ""What makes you think they aren't spending on R&D?"", 'This is just what happens to tech stocks that go from a growth profile to a value profile."
572,"If they could come up with something as world-changing as a smart phone again, they could repeat or at least justify how they are currently perceived."
573,But what would that device be?
574,The market could really use a shake-out because a lot of valuations are not based so much on reality as on perceptions that have held momentum in the imagination.
575,"But I say that as a value investor!', 'Only exposure to $AAPL that I want going forward is through $BRK-B ‚Ä¶ They have been slipping all over themselves recently."
576,"Luckily they have a Phone moat.', ""The vision pro isn't really a dud though."
577,It's a test product.
578,VR is definitely coming whether you like it or not.
579,"Even if it is not a productivity monster out of the gate, it's definitely going to be a big part in gaming in the very near future."
580,"We all knew Vision pro wouldn't sell well, it wasn't even competing with Quest 3."", 'Apple is the undoubted leader of personal tech."
581,And tech is only going to get more and more personal.
582,Getting people comfortable with something entirely new is a long and slow process.
583,"Stock might not grow leaps and bounds quickly, but my vote‚Äôs on apple that it will grow for a long time.', 'Chinese IPhone shipments are currently up 12%.', ""The fact that people are even saying stuff like this makes me so bullish on Apple long term."
584,Apple has almost died multiple times in its history and those were possibly the greatest investing opportunities in our lifetimes.
585,They have a ton of room to grow and into markets they aren't currently participating.
586,"They take some chances that dont always work out, and some first versions of products seem stupid and then become huge like the ipad and watch."", '$AAPL is and always will be great place to park cash', 'To piggyback on this‚Ä¶ as someone who got lucky and invested a small amount in Apple in 2016‚Ä¶ should I sell and bite the bullet on the tax bill in order to better invest my money?"
587,Looking at a tax bill of about $3200 but frees up about 17k.
588,"Good post OP!', 'OP forgot number 7  7."
589,"Warren Buffett just sold 13% of his stake in AAPL  13% might not sound like much, but he owned a shitload of stock to begin with so yea, it\'s a lot and he\'ll likely continue to shed  As far as innovations go, they\'re touting AI as the new frontier."
590,I\'m guessing we\'ll see SIRI on steroids which is supposed to be mind blowing.
591,"AAPL hasn\'t had an insanely great product since iPhone, yes the company is in trouble long term."
592,"I\'m the biggest Apple fan boy there is, have every product they make: iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple TV, 27"" iMac, 24"" iMac, 13"" MacBook Air, etc...', 'Apple is getting into AI.', 'Its not up to apple, its up to the people, if iphone dies apple dies, rest of their products are just complimentary."
593,Its just a very risky investment.
594,"Next big thing in smarphones, is it gonna be apple?"
595,Thats what you are betting on.
596,"If lets say huawei build a crazy phone and everyone goes nuts, there goes apple.', ""I do not think it really has a 'moat', as some people keep bringing up."
597,"It's just a phone and laptop manufacturer, and not nearly the best or the most popular."", 'Apple has the best CPU‚Äôs on the market in a day where the best cpu/gpu makes the market."
598,They‚Äôre undervalued do to bigger investors being pop culture incompetent.
599,"Once Apple allows developer freedom; makes gaming a focus; or Begin selling chips outright; üìà.', 'V1 Vision Pro was a dud - this post lacks credibility."
600,"It was priced at $3,500, it wasn‚Äôt supposed to sell a ton, it was supposed to sho x that Apple will continue to make the best consumer electronics as we get transmission past ‚ÄúVR has to suck because we don‚Äôt have the technology.‚Äù By all accounts from the effective beta testers it‚Äôs mind blowing.', 'no, who else is there?', ""Declining revenue company."
601,No new markets.
602,"They make lots of money but don't do anything."", 'Not at all."
603,They have the best delivery system for AI tools.
604,"They‚Äôll continue to grow.', 'Saying the Vision Pro was a dud is definitely an oversimplification."
605,"Wait 5 years and then give opinions, but apple products are notorious at bad launches with a nice turnaround over the next 3-5 years."
606,"Take for example the apple watch, apple pencil, or even airpods."
607,"Apple seemingly doesn‚Äôt make duds because the base product and ecosystem is always improving.', ""How many iPhones can people keep buying?"
608,I'm surprised it's been growing all these fucking years.
609,"Are people trading phones every year??"", '1."
610,No they\'re not.
611,"Fake info from a known speculator ""analyst""."
612,They wouldn\'t have capacity to sell 750k in a year due to low display yields.
613,"Analysts who claimed it also claimed conflicting informations a few months ago  Source: https://www.uploadvr.com/apple-vision-pro-production-cut-claims-debunked/  I think Apple is fine at least a few more years, iPhone didn\'t penetrate poorer segments of the world that is getting richer right now.', ""That's exactly why they went down and post a lot of money."
614,"Now they're focusing on AI-enchanced Siri, robotics, and AI chip in their new iPads and MacBooks."
615,Which the investors like.
616,"But the same problem is how expensive it'll be"", 'Yes.', 'The vision pro thing was a manufactured story."
617,"They didn‚Äôt pull back', 'Augmented Reality is a really important growth vector if they want to maintain the ‚Äúhigh growth‚Äù persona."
618,"Otherwise, they‚Äôve somewhat wasted a decade of real innovation potential with minor feature and performance upgrades to squeeze every last drop from the consumer."
619,"Humane and Rabbit had shit product releases, but they demonstrate that new entrants think they can take market share from Apple in the next big wave of consumer products."
620,"Not good.', ""Yes."
621,They covered for a bad quarter with the buyback and dividend.
622,"I'll be using it for may charitable gifts this year."", 'People in this thread missing the major thing they should be concerned about, PRICE  Nobody is denying that Apple is an amazing company."
623,No one is saying that the iPhone is going away.
624,"But you are paying now for a company that is priced for growth, a company which has had negative quarters of revenue for the last 6 quarters."
625,Apple is a fantastic company but the price just does not match up with the fundamentals.
626,If the price declines further it will be a good purchase.
627,"This isn‚Äôt a company that is growing and also expensive like NVIDIA over the past year, this is a company that is REDUCING its revenue quarter over quarter but is still more expensive than many companies in the S&P', ""Apple is the second most profitable company in the world."
628,But It often gets lost on people who prefer windows pcs and Android phones.
629,Kinda silly to think that they're falling off a cliff...
630,"They've actually been recovering quite well since their stock started to plummet a few months ago."", 'Would like to see them capitalize on their tech presence with advertising."
631,"Lucrative margins and scale to reach gen Z.', ""No."
632,There just isn't anything new coming out right now.
633,"VR is cool for video games, but not for everyday life."
634,"That is why it flopped oh and its $3k price tag."", 'Partly the slow low growth thing is why I no longer have it as the big percentage in my portfolio; but I have faith in them."
635,I still like the mac mini; has tremendous more upside    They need to market it better.
636,They need to sell monitors (not just the one billion dollar monitor) to match it.
637,Apple folk could have a nice matching suite.
638,"Mini Monitor Phone Watch Pad  Tie it all together with a remote /keyboard / cloud controller', 'Vision pro not a dud."
639,"Probably one of the most impressive pieces of technology I have ever set hands on', 'No', 'Nope."
640,"AAPL is so tapped into subscription services now and is less reliant on hardware than ever before.', ""Microsoft's more promising future is already priced in."
641,"You get AAPL cheaper because of it's more uncertain future."", 'The only way Apple would be in trouble is another company delivers a new product or service that has an iPhone moment.', 'I‚Äôm a ultra bull on apple."
642,If the price goes down more in the next month or year I will add more .
643,"No doubt they are a long term bag holder for me', 'I‚Äôm worried medium term about Buffet dumping 13% of his stocks and Apple not presenting something substantial AI related in the upcoming WWDC.', 'Theyre almost a lifestyle brand masquerading ad a tech company."
644,They have had so many quality of life changes on their phones.
645,Few days ago my phone generated a collage of photos of my son growing up.
646,"Genuinely made me cry, it was wonderful."
647,"Idk if anyone else does that, they have their own cash sending thing, a friggin savings account, and theyre a major household name."
648,If they could get Siri to be worth using via AI it could be a real treat.
649,But that being said idk how they grow from here.
650,The vision pro has potential but its ahead of its time.
651,"They could continue to offer services to their customers akin to the savings acct, for example they were rumored to be launching an internal stock trading app before the previous market downturn."
652,Guess what i am saying their growth in the immediate future is probably going to relate to services.
653,"Tech has potential long term though.', 'Most women would never use anything but apple."
654,I like em because of the simplicity.
655,"It just works', 'CarPlay is a potential opportunity long run if they can find a way to monetize it, there is also room to grow in services."
656,"Apple can take a wait and see approach to a lot of things, they weren‚Äôt first with a watch or earbuds but are able to become dominant players because of the ecosystem.', 'The people bearish on Apple have a personal hate towards Apple products that cloud their judgement."
657,"They will never change to bullish no matter what Apple does', ""Sell your AAPL so I can pick it up on a discount."
658,People doubting Apple is a tale as old as time.
659,They always come back and dominate new product lines.
660,First watch was shit too and so was first iPad.
661,Not to mention the first iPhone was not that popular.
662,You are looking in hindsight will all those product lines.
663,I'm not at all concerned about the Vision Pro being a dud.
664,I own one and it is absolutely the future.
665,Tech and SW just isn't there yet for mass market.
666,When those 2 things converge it's going to be a big deal.
667,"It might take longer than iPhone or watch to take off, but it's also way more complicated of a device, so not surprising."
668,The big issue is the market wants results yesterday for products launched today.
669,"So I can't predict what AAPL will due in short term but I have no concerns in long term."", ""Yep."
670,"IMO, it is the stereotypical company that catches investors off guard with the transition from 'growth' to 'mature dividender'."
671,"The next CSCO or INTC"", 'Mildly concerned, I like to focus on companies that are moving more into services for consumers and enterprise."
672,"With Apple mostly hardware focused and them cancelling the Apple Car and slow to move on AI I‚Äôve reduced my weekly investment into them but still have no interest in selling my current position.', 'Just buy and hold both.', '1) wasn‚Äôt a dud, I believe there‚Äôs more the production news I haven‚Äôt read it completely but I‚Äôm aware there‚Äôs more 2) they were on a high, normalising right now, market saturation, will increase services revenue  3) huh?"
673,"No no dude it did I‚Äôm not aware of the numbered but it sure did üíÄ 4) buybacks aren‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing  5) India  6) they‚Äôve the brand to carry a new product launch aimed at masses', ""I wouldn't worry, but they aren't growing for the past few years, and not much of a going forward growth story either."", 'Vision Pro is a dud?"
674,And you have concluded already?
675,No one was expecting folks to lineup and buy these like iPhones.
676,It is a new product in a new domain.
677,"The technology has to mature, solid use cases have (and will) to emerge."
678,I see it successful in 3-4 years from now.
679,"Remember, the same was said about iPads, Watch too."
680,It takes time.
681,A part of the reason the iPhone sales are down is because how good they are built.
682,My iPhone 6S still works like a charm.
683,I intend to keep my 12 pro for another year or so and pass on to my kids.
684,And it is for this reason I don‚Äôt buy another product for which an Apple alternative exists.
685,I‚Äôve a 2016 Apple TV still working fine.
686,"In the meantime, I‚Äôve cycled through a few firesticks, Rokus etc."
687,they became useless after a couple of years.
688,"Regarding your point #3, please tell me you were not serious.', ""Innovation in Apple is certainly waning."
689,I'm not as optimistic as I was before.
690,This is where I think Tim Cook has just been satisfied with Apple being a cash cow rather than innovation.
691,Who is more innovative?
692,Microsoft or Apple?
693,This is why Microsoft is valued higher.
694,Apple's playing it way too safe prioritizing financials rather than jumping back into the lab and coming out with new product/services.
695,"If it weren't for their services segment, they would be in trouble."
696,Apple's buyback was fine.
697,It's the size of it.
698,It just tells me that they're running out of ideas and shareholders want answers on how Apple was going to use that money.
699,It was sorta a buffer because they knew the shares would tumble with a rather weak earnings.
700,India's a huge market for Apple so we've gotta wait for some growth there.
701,But there's so many competitors in China that people aren't exactly enamored with Apple all the way through.
702,Gen Z's owning an iPhone doesn't really prove much.
703,U.S.
704,growth in iPhone is stagnant.
705,That's not the issue for Apple.
706,Apple's issue is iPhone sales internationally.
707,The U.S.
708,smartphone market is already saturated.
709,Anyone who wants an iPhone has no barrier to buying one.
710,"The market Apple needs to penetrate, still, is Brazil, India, Asian countries, etc.,  If it's a contest of whether Apple can print money, sure, no one's better than them at it, honestly."
711,But the innovation is key.
712,Because all it takes is for some other company to out-innovate you and take your FUTURE market share.
713,And I don't honestly see Apple being innovative.
714,"It's a given that every year, Apple will just have a new Macbook/iPhone/iPad."
715,What else?
716,Vision is still TBD.
717,"It actually looks stupid as hell, if you ask me."
718,Clearly not ready for the market.
719,They scrapped the car once they realized it was too expensive.
720,The worst mistake Apple could make is jumping into the auto business.
721,It's low margins and requires lots of capital.
722,"In Rivian's case, which there are unconfirmed rumors of, that means Apple will be subsidizing Rivian's losses."
723,"That'd make me sell my Apple shares, honestly."
724,"Seriously, what's saving Apple is their unbeatable services segment."
725,"When app developers have to pay them 30% of profits for using Apple's IOS, then it's just free $ for Apple."
726,"As long as people still hold an iPhone, that money will keep coming."
727,"But there's no innovation in that."", 'I sold a while ago for microstrategy."
728,"im up 450% since then.', 'Apple stock is only up 5% in the last year and that‚Äôs only because of the recent bump it got from the buyback announcement."
729,Meanwhile the S&P is up 25% from last year.
730,"So yeah, as an Apple investor, I am not happy.', 'No, I am not."
731,Long term hold for me.
732,Cost basis in the $40s.
733,"Probably will never sell it.', 'zephyr slim simplistic thought quiet support melodic swim automatic familiar   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*', '+ The car was canceled."
734,I personally have little faith in their ability to innovate after Jobs.
735,"If inventing the Mac, the iPod and the iPhone were that easy, he wouldn‚Äôt have been Steve Jobs."
736,"Jobs was a car fanatic and could have made it work.', 'at this point apple will (probably) never die and will be able to beat Inflation, Market has completely saturated and IMO it will near future will become more of cyclical stock (when people are buying phones after 5 years)."
737,APPL is still a stock to hold if you want at the end of investment phase or people with lower risk appetite.
738,"UNLESS APPLE really make a meaningful INNOVATION this will be the new constant', ""It may become IBM?"
739,"IBM hasn't died"", 'Hopefully they start increasing their div yield', 'They said this back in 2017 too', 'I reckon people said the same 5 years ago', ""Umm..."
740,"AAPL has been the King of the stock market for nearly 2 decades, that's totally insane."
741,No other stock has had such an uninterrupted run as a Top market leader for anywhere near that long.

749,In my opinion we are starting to see that happen.

765,Apple\'s end game here are wearable glasses with the same functionality as Vision Pro but indistinguishable from normal sunglasses.
766,It\'s only then that we\'ll see how much value there is in this new product line.

780,> Such a major buyback (biggest in history) can only mean one thing: Apple\'s confidence in its own roadmap and future growth.
781,Disagree.
782,"It means they are confident in revenue stability, not necessarily growth, and they have explicitly stated as much."
783,I would say this point is thoroughly debunked in the comments already posted.
784,> China growth might be slowing down but other emerging markets such as India are just starting to take off.
785,This is one of Apple\'s few potential growth markets for iPhone.
786,I believe they hold about 5% or 6% of market share in India.

791,What percentage of Apple\'s services revenue reies on the prevalence of their own hardware?

796,"As they have become more expensive and as they pretty much have all the features they ever will have outside of minor incremental improvements (better camera, more memory, faster processor, etc), no reason to upgrade as often."
797,So I‚Äôm on a 3 year cycle now.
798,That may eventually extend to four years.
799,Apple‚Äôs margins are ridiculous for such an established company.
800,It‚Äôs still an amazing business.
801,It‚Äôs certainly not ‚Äúgoing anywhere‚Äù but I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs going to grow revenue at a pace we are used to seeing.
802,"What new products are left for them to delve into?', 'I think for point 5 iPhone sales were higher than predicted.', 'Apple needs something that can sell a lot."

810,The Vision Pro is a *spectacular failure* and a great example of how Apple has truly lost its way.
811,Chasing tends that can\'t survive outside Silicone Valley boardrooms instead of marketable products.
812,Apple had a head start in smartphones but has failed to capitalise.
813,Over time the marketshare for Android just keeps growing and iPhone shrinking world wide.
814,The US is locked due to carrier deals deciding for people but even here things are changing.
815,"Growth is supposed to increase every year in percentages, using dollars to make it sound big is yet another sign of weakness."
816,The actual YoY growth is slowing for Apple but not competing companies.
817,Worrisome to say the least.
818,"Even more copium, you\'ll be a legendary bagholder and fanboy."
819,Buybacks are due to Apple being *unable to innovate*.
820,They litterary can\'t make another good product to compete and hence have no qejete to put the money.
821,This is a *bad sign* for a supposedly growth company.
822,India is poor as fuck.
823,Billion population where the average salary is less then I make when I take a leak at work.
824,The *minimal* upper middle class of India can\'t offset the total purchasing power of a middle sized American town.
825,Thinking India will save apple is downright stupid.
826,"They lack basic hygiene and toilets, they can\'t afford iPhones and and product Apple sells there is *sold at a massive discount* cutting into profits."

833,"Vision Pro is a failure and the step between the special needs helmet (Vision Pro) and a ""glasses"" model is many *decades* of R&D."

835,"The sales are abysmal comapred to old school (logical) Apple products.', ""> Apple's end game here are wearable glasses with the same functionality as Vision Pro but indistinguishable from normal sunglasses."
836,"That is just so so far away, like multiple decades and probably not even solvable since people already complain about the lack of FOV with Vision Pro."
837,You'd have to go full bug eye and those went really out of fashion and that wouldn't even be enough.
838,>The iPhone isn't going anywhere.
839,The argument is that sales are going down.
840,People need to upgrade less due to hardware plateauing and that gives competitors middle range to catch up.
841,As well as the prestige to leave it for other markets.
842,>Such a major buyback (biggest in history) can only mean one thing: Apple's confidence in its own roadmap and future growth.
843,That's just not what that means from an investing standpoint.\\  >China growth might be slowing down but other emerging markets such as India are just starting to take off.
844,Yet to be seen.

875,Apple One subscription bundled with Apple TV is driving growth.
876,It is still within Apple ecosystem owners.
877,Apple should act as an aggregator for streaming services instead of being forced to pay for each individually.
878,"Netflix missed that boat.', ""You may be surprised to learn that Apple makes far more money on device sales than on its 30% commissions from apps bought for the device by its owner."
879,Imagine an iPhone sold at $700 (lower than actual average sales price) with a 25% profit margin (also lower than actual margin).
880,That's $175 profit.
881,"To make even an additional 20 percent additional profit in 30% app commissions (which is actually 15% for small developers <$1M revenue, 30% for large) and assuming the app store is completely free to run, the user would have to spend $116 on apps for that device during its lifetime."
882,"Apps purchased carry forward to new devices, and iPad/iPhone apps only have to be purchased once per user not per device, so most users aren't constantly buying new apps."
883,"This is also why a lot of apps are switching to a subscription model but there is a lot of backlash over this."", 'so what has Microsoft been innovating on?', 'u can still get really good returns with companies like that."

891,"No sane observer expects Apple to roll over and die, but they have not been a leader in a high-growth market since Jobs died."

962,Services is 75% gross margin and growing.
963,"Let's assume 37% gross margin on their iPhones, which did $46 billion in sales last Q."
964,That means gross profit for iPhones is $17 billion.
965,Services reached $17.8 billion.
966,"So unless you have evidence of iPhones earning more money, please demonstrate it."
967,The % benchmark is irrelevant because Apple does $23 billion in services revenue per quarter.
968,Most of the top apps are paying that 30% rate.
969,You don't seem to realize that the services includes microtransactions.
970,We're talking about in-game currencies and purchased content.
971,Saying the apps transfer to the same device doesn't explain how Apple is doing $23+ billion revenue quarterly.

981,I will say when prices and products available is at a better point then yes‚Ä¶ also each Vision Pro needs to be calibrated to one user once they figure that out it will move as well‚Ä¶.
982,Phones are lasting longer.
983,iPhone still has both holding power and software updates compared to other phone‚Ä¶ maybe not great for Apple but not bad for customers.

1049,"To expect a growth up to the absurd 90% levels seen in US teens isn't realistic, the US is the outliers not the rule here."", 'Agreed."

1127,"To expound on that, it\'s not ""apple"" and ""android"", there are many different brands that use the android os."
1128,I happen to think samsung is the most quality of those brands.

1143,"but if we hope for another increase like 4-5 times the initial cost, won't that make the dividend less valuable cuz it will start buying even less shares annually?"
1144,"or do you hope they raise the dividend enough during that time?"", ""i just learned that questrade doesn't offer fractional shares in DRIP lmao they've been saying they plan to for years apparently."
1145,"i'm tryna think of the best thing to do in this case, save up the dividends and put them into more advantageous stocks when they're worth the commission fees etc.?"", 'And yet, when affordability is less of an issue in richer markets, people choose an iPhone."

1161,"Of course, the purpose of Apple's ecosystem is to get you so invested you never bother to switch out."
1162,"And they've clearly done pretty well with that model, considering most of their users end up owning multiple products and multiple generations of products."

1382,Here is my prediction when the stock will kick back.
1383,"Next iPhone 16 when they introduce the ""new"" Ai feature that Pixel and even Samsung have implemented."
1384,Adding in Ai features is so easy that it should be added in an update.

1759,So far they the basically just hype trading here.
1760,I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be rushing to consumer non necessities right now.
1761,I think their iPhone sales declining speaks to that.
1762,"But it could go up Goodluck', 'Never forget they ‚Äúproposed‚Äù share buyback to stop their stock price from cratering.', 'Thinking same."
1763,Those calls 197.5 and 200 for 6/7 cheap.
1764,"6/14 not bad too.', 'I‚Äôve got some 300c leaps, probably going to tank.', 'Hey Siri, find me a back of a Wendy‚Äôs', 'I agree about solid buy but AAPL is not at all time high."
1765,"It sat out most of the 24 rally, in fact.', 'Holding $200c 7/19."
1766,"I think it‚Äôll pass ath soon after wwdc', 'Similar argument could be said about nvida too.', 'Most people still dont know much about Chatgpt, or ChatGPT4o Voice mode."
1767,Soon 2 billion people are about to find out.
1768,The question is who is gonna monetize all this usage the most; Apple?
1769,Microsoft Azure?
1770,"OpenAI obviously, but we cannot buy OpenAI', 'I‚Äôm not supporting spyware companies anymore', 'They should announce needing nvda for the AI backbone."
1771,Yes they need to announce.
1772,"I agree and calls here going into nvda split.', 'Apples ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be first, be better‚Äù technique has a good track record', 'Been holding aapl for years I‚Äôll never sell it', 'AAPL‚Äôs growth has stagnated, but it keeps making profit, what can investors gain from the stock besides dividends?"
1773,"Stocks buyback is not a long term solution.', 'There‚Äôs hope for my $220 6/14 Calls', 'Shhhh don‚Äôt tell him‚Ä¶   Apple is in negotiations with Google to use their AI', 'They fact that they are using chatgpt for their Siri means they are so far behind in the AI game that they have nothing new to offer."
1774,"Puts', 'Shit i just got calls on Friday,', 'Another takes the byte out of the apple."
1775,"![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)', 'Puts puts puts üí∞ ü§ë üí∏', 'Apple is not gonna grow anymore it‚Äôs gonna stall', 'The comments on here show that many of my fellow regards dont have a clue about ‚ÄúAI‚Äù."
1776,AI is not some recent breakthrough and apple has been leveraging machine learning algos for years.
1777,Avoid buzzwords from shit biz rags and read up on the various areas of ML and the possible applications.
1778,To name a few Apple apps (there are many more) that leverage ML..
1779,"Siri, photos, keyboard, face id, and many parts of iOS."
1780,"In 2017, apple released the Core ML sdk."
1781,This allows devs to incorporate ML into their iOS apps.
1782,Statistical computing is not new.
1783,"Stats, linear algebra, and calc have existed many moons."
1784,"We‚Äôve just hit the point where hardware is able to support larger models more efficiently.', ""10 years ago a Apple crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit."
1785,These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground.
1786,"Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune, dabbling in risky ventures with the Degenerates of WSB.üá∫üá≤"", 'Every time you say ""hey siri"", Apple now has to pay OpenAI / Microsoft."
1787,"How does that make Apple more profits', 'The real gains will be made when apple works out running LLMs on edge', 'Apple will be a solid sold aoon', 'Yo stfu hahaha WSB is too dumb for this smart of analysis let‚Äôs keep this shit under wraps until WWDC', ""I'm in pretty deep on aapl"", '![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)', 'Well, I read your post and I sell.', 'Puts it is', 'All blue chip tech stocks about to go vertical once better AI arrives', ""So you're 20 years late to a stock that also pays a shit dividend."
1788,"Excellent work."", 'I have 177 shares at $107."
1789,Keep it going.
1790,"One new share a year on dividends.', 'I think that big short guy has it at least somewhat right."
1791,"When all these AI apps and software start to come into play more on phones, there will be a big device upgrade cycle and that will continue to feed the Apple ecosystem train and we‚Äôll be on our way to a 5t market cap in a few years or less.', 'Read that Apple has outspent all of the other Ai companies put together buying them up."
1792,"Very curious when and what they will release.', 'I make money in The market just to spite people', 'Apple."
1793,No innovation.
1794,Just living on subscription fees.
1795,"I sold.', 'Is a Siri upgrade really going to sell any more iPhones?', 'AI siri is great but I am most excited about their chipset news."
1796,They have locked down 2nm supply from TSMC and have been leading with inboard neural processing for couple years.
1797,"Yes, couple year headstart that aligns perfectly with all this new AI technology and rise of LLM‚Äôs."
1798,"Onboard processing solves a lot of issues such as latency, privacy and security."
1799,"Yes, need more efficient models but that is also happening quickly."
1800,"Multimodal 4o is actually more efficient than GPT4, Llama is getting better."
1801,A personal agent in a phone doesn‚Äôt need to be as advanced and can still be transformative.
1802,I just wish Apple would do something surprising like go into OEM chipsets and data centers to take on Nvidia and Google.
1803,"I have heard Tom talk about Apple being so big, it‚Äôs hard to find markets meaningful enough."
1804,That may explain the exploration into EV‚Äôs.
1805,"But certainly taking on Nvidia is a big enough market.', 'You also get access to free psychological consultations at a mental institution.', 'I think there‚Äôs a good case to be made that Apple is ripe for a momentum turnaround."
1806,Whether it‚Äôll happen at WWDC remains to be seen.
1807,WWDC has historically not done wonders for the stock price.
1808,"I do, however, expect something from them in the near future."
1809,"They‚Äôre one of the tech companies actually reliably making money and growing in a sustainable way, and can‚Äôt have the rug pulled easily.', ""OpenAI relies on Nvidia chips."
1810,Apple hates Nvidia.
1811,Just weird.
1812,Apple better say AI at least 100x during wwdc.
1813,No one's buying iPads and unless Apple opens up the software and cannibalizes their Mac which they won't.
1814,Revenue will dip.
1815,"I'm buying puts."", 'why buy now..."
1816,im selling my calls from 165s.
1817,"scary to buy near top with catalyst', '‚ÄúMight‚Äù', 'I think revenue will be down."
1818,Especially in China.
1819,Not sure that AI bells and whistles are going to offset a revenue miss or less optimistic guidance.
1820,The market seems to be reacting harshly.
1821,"Even to small disappointments.', ""ATH is almost always a good time to buy because it usually keeps happening."
1822,"It's only the final ATH before the crash that you shouldn't buy into."", 'you do know that they are going to pay microsoft or google  don‚Äôt you?"
1823,"geez why are you even posting?', 'Thanks to AI, comment go byebye', 'AAPL is somehow my worst performing stock right now."
1824,"Hoping AI Siri changes that', ""The things I've read about what Apple plans to introduce in terms of ai features on their phone are pretty crap though."
1825,Like AI generated emojis and or email summary and things like that.
1826,"Is it confirmed that they will have chat gpt 4o on their phones for siri this year?"", ""Thoughts are you don't care about market cap because you use the product."", 'You‚Äôre a bit late to the party but yes still room for growth."
1827,"See my last post.', 'always long AAPL this is the way', 'I made some money from call while it was 170, just sold them this week, hope you guys calls will print this month', ""AAPL will never pump like NVDA or TSLA."
1828,It's a safe long term investment though.
1829,"Guaranteed 10k today will turn into at least 11k in 10 years."", 'No', 'Ah classic stock market noob."
1830,Buying high and then inevitably selling low.
1831,"I hope you don‚Äôt put all your money in this play ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)', ""LOL."
1832,It's so funny to hear people talk about Apple like they're actually good at deep tech.
1833,"Do you really believe they have anywhere near the talent it requires to compete with even freaking Mistral, much less Google and OpenAI?"", 'What is this shit', 'Anytime an article starts with a ""Here\'s Why"" I fucking run', 'I don‚Äôt believe in Apple and their cheap products that cost an arm and leg."
1834,"I‚Äôm good', 'The general idea is that currently there is approximately a 1.5 billion user base for iPhone."
1835,The excepted WWDC announcement for AI capabilities will most likely only work on iPhone 15 pro and pro max.
1836,iOS 18 will work on iPhone 11 and newer but will not have the compute to handle the improved Siri with AI features on device unless you have a 15 pro or pro max.
1837,The cutoff for laptops and iPads is most likely the M2 chip.
1838,There are a majority of pandemic era iPhones reaching 4 to 5 years old.
1839,Apple shipped 230 million\xa0\xa0iPhones in 2023 and 50 million in 2024.
1840,That leaves a user base of 1.4 billion with iPhones unable to handle the new SIRI AI features.....
1841,With an average cost $800 per phone you are looking at a massive upgrade cycle‚Ä¶trillions of potential revenue in 2025/2026 .
1842,"That is not taking into account how many of the recent iPhone sales were not the pro model, nor laptop, and iPads that will effectively be obsolete in the coming year.\xa0\xa0  Another bullish driver are rate cuts globally."
1843,"Lower interest rates globally will create a more accessible financing option for consumer discretionary spend, which includes phones, laptops, and accessories."
1844,The goal for AI is to be profitable.
1845,"The best way to do that is market AI to consumers, putting AAPL in the position to be a leader in the consumer AI market with AI handled on device and offering the best personal data security in the market."
1846,AAPL has entered into a price war with its major China\xa0\xa0phone competitor Huawei and seen results in increased sales in the last earnings.
1847,Being that the market is always forward looking WWDC could start an upward movement for the stock going into the iPhone 16 release in September.
1848,"Earnings in the fall with increased sales, and an election in Nov with an anticipated rate cut to follow is painting a bullish picture for AAPL.', 'Nobody talking about this but it‚Äôs seriously a buy."
1849,"Since the WWDC, the AI game and joint ops of Google & Apple means a solid AI experience for WEB BROWSING."
1850,Yes they can limit what we see but the experience for the general user will be universal and generally aimed to support what consumers are searching for.
1851,Long term call options that will rake in 500% minimum by half of their terms.
1852,Ride the waves.
1853,Also long term msft.
1854,"My options are already 100% return for October exp.', ""Oh, did you think I was speaking to current holders when I said it could be a buy?"
1855,"I'm suggesting that non-current holders may want to buy in."", 'msft vs netscape repeated."
1856,"netscape won, and msft became the richest, most powerful corporation on earth.', 'DoJ is overreaching to an extreme level on this one, in my opinion.', 'Tim Apple to DoJ."
1857,"Come suck my iPhone.', ""Huh?"
1858,"They're still growing, if the 300% return of the past 5 years says anything"", ""They have a good 5 year EPS growth rate and return a lot of value to share holders through buybacks and dividends."
1859,"It's as solid as a stock as any out there."", 'AIAIAIAIAI', ""This is exactly what I'm thinking."", 'If?"
1860,It‚Äôs guaranteed my dude.
1861,"!banbet', 'News on hardware partners ?', '$250 by the end of this year with the iPhones 16 comes out and with all the apps up grade to AI apps‚Ä¶.AAPl to the moon.', 'Holy bullish', 'You called?"
1862,"Forever bullish on AAPL', '![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)iPhone is dead when it lost me, a loyal regarded user', 'I suspect your portfolio will be too.', ""That's certainly one of the takes of all time"", 'It could be the new ford ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)', 'RemindMe!"
1863,"10 years', 'There is an argument here."
1864,Their hardware has not had a significant upgrade since Steve Jobs era.
1865,They were late to the software/services/SaaS game and now appear to have missed the boat entirely on AI.\xa0  AI powered Siri is not going to fundamentally change anything.
1866,"It will enhance existing capabilities but much like adding a third camera most people will not care.', 'RemindMe!"
1867,"10 years', ""Phones and tablets would need to be completely irrelevant in 10 years, which I don't see happening."", 'Just buy the stock it‚Äôs a defense stock won‚Äôt go up like crazy', 'How the fuck are you bagholding aapl?"
1868,"True regard', 'Someone needs to provide the wealth so it can be redistributed, so thanks!', 'In a different timeline they when ahead and bought Tesla and yahoo bought Google', 'I guess it is more profitable to manufacture and sell 20 expensive phones than one affordable car.', 'Agree it was a good call to get out, but that overstates the impact of that project on AAPL."
1869,It made sense when the self driving car drums were beating loudly.
1870,"Everyone was working on something, not everyone talked about it."
1871,The money they spent on Project Titan over 10 years doesn‚Äôt even move the needle on their sheets.
1872,Meta spent more in 1 year on their failed metaverse adventure than Apple did over a decade.
1873,"I think it was more a decision that the experiment had run its course and Apple is particularly good about walking away from things, unlike some of its competitors.', 'They should buy Rivian', ""Exactly what I reasoned."
1874,"I'm not super bullish on Apple, but this is the only reason I'd invest."
1875,"Management has enough foresight to can the project."", 'This."
1876,Some people think AAPL are bearish because they cut cars.
1877,"I thought it was a smart move all along.', ""Haha spot on."
1878,"But shit, if your competitor to the likes of Samsung ain't exploring it (conglomerate, synergies and all), then don't fuck around to find out to begin with."
1879,"This is of course admittedly in hindsight."", '[deleted]', 'Same but 200', 'I don‚Äôt get why people think ai is just a new assistant."
1880,"The assistant is literally the shittiest use case for it designed to appeal to the masses', 'I agree that apple AI won‚Äôt be as powerful or robust, but the reality is that it doesn‚Äôt have to be."
1881,"Apple has such a broad share of the tech market that all they have to do is create a consumer grade AI that stretches across all their OS, apps, and subscriptions."
1882,"Everything will become easier and more accessible to the consumer and the more Apple products the end user has the more they will benefit from AI.', ""If AI can't be forced to adhere to the laws of logic then it won't be more than a not so trustworthy assistant (or a handy database of various facts)."
1883,"It'll lie to your face and you'll never know it"", 'Apple does hardware."
1884,AI in hardware form is what they‚Äôll do.
1885,"I‚Äôm waiting for the Apple Robot.', 'They already made their own chips for everything that are, quite frankly, superior to their peers."
1886,"Making their own specific chip to do some bullshit AI is not beyond their reach', 'They will cave to nvdia.', 'It feels good when a stranger on WSB says a certain stock should have been bought at the same price I did."

1890,They trained it too heavily on Reddit.
1891,"Then, there‚Äôs all the BS where the image generators were putting diversity over everything, where you‚Äôd ask for images of Nazi soldiers and it would show black and Latino people."
1892,"Google isn‚Äôt well trusted in the AI segment.', 'I‚Äôve got a decent chunk stashed in $200 6/14 calls RN; I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic', 'Well considering the event is 6/10, calls for 6/7 won‚Äôt have the same upside."

1894,We‚Äôre still so early in its development and have no clue who the big players will be in 20 years.
1895,"OpenAI could be the AOL of AI', ""Don't be first be more expensive and have the illusion of premium"", ""'don't be first, market better'"", 'It‚Äôs possible.', 'That would be excellent for my $190 7/19 calls', 'I just bought 7/19 calls for $235 let‚Äôs hope baby', 'Nah google AI ain‚Äôt it', 'I agree with you on this, but we seem to be in the minority', ""Honestly, if you think that ChatGPT is behind in the AI game, that's nuts."
1896,Have you been keeping up with developments such as 4o?
1897,"I would assume not, based on this comment."
1898,"Siri at the level of GPT 4o would be a game changer, not to mention the fact that GPT 5 is in the works."", 'Bagholder spotted."

1900,"I think the key will be Apple releasing an AI product that encourages existing Apple consumers to update their ""still just fine"" devices to the new generation.', 'Mr T cook?', 'Because Her is one step closer to reality with the integration of 4o', 'and they are in a great position to do so."
1901,they have the silicon and the user base.
1902,"plus it perfectly aligns with the privacy marketing bs.', 'Haha', 'Someone has to lose money', 'The entire S&P will go vertical with unemployment."
1903,"What a day to be alive and not poor.', 'lol you‚Äôre allowed to buy a high performing stock at multiple points to maximize your return, buddy', 'lol they just released one of the most impressive pieces of augmented reality technology to exist', 'when it brings Her one step closer to reality, yes.', ""Haha, I hope they don't mess with NVDA's market."
1904,I have their shares too and support their monopoly lol.
1905,I think the biggest thing will be that iphone users get siri as essentially a personal companion who will talk to them about anything.
1906,"That will sell more than most people would expect."", 'Speaking from personal experience?', 'Yeah I agree."
1907,I think the sideways trend has been going for long enough that a break up or down makes sense.

1909,"They need at least 175 AI mentions', 'Ok thanks for your input you seem like a mature individual', 'Haha yeah it‚Äôs been trending sideways for awhile', ""Nothing is super confirmed yet, except a deal between Apple and OpenAI of some sort."

1924,I would be shocked however if they stay alive sadly...
1925,"so a buyout might save the legacy :/', 'AWS spawned from a core competency of Amazon‚Äôs organically, in a high growth, high margin, low capex market that they helped create from the beginning."
1926,"Apple started up R&D on cars from scratch in a market they didn‚Äôt know anything about that‚Äôs low margin and extremely complex, highly regulated, very expensive to enter, and very competitive', 'Doesn‚Äôt AAPL always gain on the ‚Äúrumor‚Äù and drop on the ‚Äúnews‚Äù?"

1955,The slide will start this year..
1956,"by October for sure."", ""Absolutely."
1957,"I don't know about you but I sell high, buy low."
1958,"This dude talking about buying AAPL at all time highs LOL"", 'With a p/e of 30 they need to innovate or you are getting a 1%/year return indefinitely at this price."
1959,"Please stop going full regard.', 'You accidentally typed 20 instead of 2.', '‚Ä¶and another one', 'The diversity image generation was fixed like immediately but ok', 'AOL of AI is a powerful statement.', '$200 calls for 7/19 here', ""Apple didn't develop it."
1960,"You are missing the point"", 'This is it', 'But that just means openai makes all the money', '100%, i imagine it will take a few years to get there though', 'not holding aapl = lose money?"
1961,"lol', 'Cheers üç∑', ""I think that everyone is expecting big things to do with AI at this conference."
1962,And the things I read in a bloomberg article were very underwhelming.
1963,Analysts like Dan Niles have been calling this apple event the most consequential for them in a decade or something like that on CNBC.
1964,So there are a lot of expectations.
1965,Apple will have to live up to them for the stock price to go up.
1966,And I think it's already been strong in anticipation.
1967,I think a Siri that is basically Chat GPT 4o would do the trick.
1968,That's why I was wondering.
1969,"But I don't know enough about how easy/hard it would be for apple to integrate that the next iPhone's release date, even if the deal is confirmed."
1970,PS.
1971,"Dan Niles seems to be a huge bull on everything, including Tesla which has been a terrible performer."", 'Me to !"
1972,"We should team up for our share holder votes guys!!!', 'Agree."
1973,"Some people are commenting like ‚Äúidiot why didn‚Äôt you buy in 2010‚Äù üòÇüò≠', 'Fair points', 'Thinner is better?', 'Oooo but wait this time it‚Äôll be WATER RESISTANT ooooo aaaaaa', 'My b brother I didn‚Äôt see you said calls."
1974,"Thought you meant shares and I was going to slap you', 'haha', '""I dunno.."
1975,"let me yahoo that"" doesn\'t quite roll of the tongue the same way', 'That‚Äôs some deep thinking right there.', 'Yea and Mcdonalds never sold its shares of Chipotle', 'Right around the time when Borders bought Amazon', 'A different timeline and a parallel universe are related concepts but are not exactly the same."
1976,- **Different Timeline**: This typically refers to a sequence of events that diverges from a certain point in a known timeline.
1977,"For example, if you go back in time and change a historical event, you might create a new timeline where events unfold differently from that point onward."
1978,This concept is often used in time travel narratives.
1979,"- **Parallel Universe**: This refers to an entirely separate and independent universe that exists alongside our own, often with different laws of physics, histories, or versions of reality."
1980,Parallel universes are a common concept in theories of the multiverse.
1981,"In summary, a different timeline is a variation of an existing timeline created by changes in events, while a parallel universe is a completely separate existence that may or may not be related to our own.', 'What is?"
1982,They aren‚Äôt even competing directly right now and we are many years away from a consumer ready wearable.
1983,The addressable market for the current state of the art is laughably small.
1984,Apple‚Äôs foray was intended to engage the developer community and offer a glimpse of what‚Äôs possible on its platforms.
1985,You can‚Äôt do what Apple did on Vision in a $300 package like Meta x Rayban or even for the cost of the most expensive Oculus headset.
1986,Both companies know this.
1987,Vision was meant as a technical flex as Apple enters stage.
1988,"They achieved some impressive things with Vision v1 and it‚Äôs awesome kit to mess around with - [just ask Meta‚Äôs former head of oculus.](https://hugo.blog/2024/03/11/vision-pro/).', ""It's trivially easy to build a beautiful car."
1989,Plenty of companies do it.
1990,"It's hard to get it into production profitably."", ""Lucid is probably too far gone."
1991,But Apple's expertise in manufacturing and deep pockets make sense.
1992,"Apple could buy it with about a week's worth of cash flow."", 'I don‚Äôt know but aapl is so money it doesn‚Äôt even know it baby', ""> who's going to upgrade their iphone for $1000  Becky will."
1993,"Doesn't even need a reason."", 'People upgrade their iPhones every 2-3 years on average."
1994,"People who buy iPhones also buy iPads, Apple Watches, Apple TV, Apple Music, etc."
1995,and use these things everyday.
1996,"Apple is already deeply embedded in the market and that is their main advantage', 'They already have the neural engine, so they‚Äôre in the AI space now."
1997,"I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them to either start with nvda and transition to in-house designs or just stay in-house the whole time.', 'Competition is good for the business."
1998,"NVDA being the only one means we can‚Äôt have cheaper, better options."
1999,"Wanting AAPL to succeed in an AI race is in everyone‚Äôs interest (unless that‚Äôs not their goal at all)', 'Don\'t get so caught up in the numbers."
2000,Why is 190 ATh?
2001,Because someone says so right?
2002,So just say otherwise.
2003,"Just say ""I believe"" that 190 is in fact the bottom."
2004,"Because up is down and right is wrong.', 'Post **your** positions then.', 'You‚Äôre one of those regards that thinks short volume is the same as short interest, aren‚Äôt you?', ""It's more the fact that that kind of thing happens in the first place."
2005,"If you're constantly doing dumb shit, does it really matter if you apologize, after the fact, every time?"", 'Why would Apple buy a product from OpenAI if they didn‚Äôt expect a return on investment somehow?"
2006,That‚Äôs a basic business principle.
2007,"I think Apple will benefit from the deal.', ""wow you're smart you figured it out!"", ""Yeah, I agree with everything you're saying for sure."", 'Unless it‚Äôs so thin that it breaks in your pocket', 'Most phones these days are already water resistant with IP68 rating."
2008,Some can even handle full submersion for several minutes at less than six meters of depth.
2009,"I think the selling point for Apple this year will probably be marginal upgrades on the camera, the display, battery life, and more than likely faster CPU."
2010,"Otherwise, the phone will look the same as the current generation."
2011,"Honestly, Apple should‚Äôve kept the ‚ÄúS‚Äù line ‚Äî as the upcoming iPhone would‚Äôve been less disappointing if it were named the 15S as opposed to 16, where people are expecting some sort of actual improvement.', 'Got shares those too."
2012,"Been holding those for 25+ years.', 'And ‚Äúlet me bing it‚Äù is a tad too sexual', 'I had to Ask Jeeves about this', 'You just shout ""YahhhoooooOooooo"".', ""Funny."
2013,"That's exactly what we used to say back in the day."", 'I also heard in that timeline Cathy Wood never sold NVDA', ""And the guys behind the dumpster bought Wendy's with gains from options"", 'In other words: ‚Äúunder imaginary circumstance‚Äù', 'I‚Äôm not going to read this essay.', ""Don't forget Debbie as well"", ""congrats, great PR."
2014,I haven't updated my iphone.
2015,Still 13 and no urge to upgrade.
2016,ipad from 2018 with no urge to upgrade.
2017,no TV.
2018,"there are zealots and there are practical people."", 'I am amazed."
2019,Apparently the m4 chip will be driving all this with the Siri update next year to match.
2020,Most phones cannot local AI.
2021,So yup.
2022,I‚Äôm amazed and wrong.
2023,Posts left for accountability.
2024,I see this now as Apple fuck yes and nvidia drop.
2025,It‚Äôs in macrumors which are really investigated.
2026,I recommend a look at the Apple sub.
2027,See what users are looking forward too.
2028,It‚Äôs huge.
2029,You are correct.
2030,They have a huge win and lock against nvidia now.
2031,I understand the wait.
2032,"Lots of infrastructure and no nvidia.', 'I believe they can software wise."
2033,I don‚Äôt think they can fab a chip to have servers.
2034,Not soon.
2035,Nvidia is just the hardware.
2036,I think they forced a collab.
2037,Apple cannot just handle the integration without the hardware.
2038,They hate nvidia but that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs late announcement.
2039,How long would apple take to catch up?
2040,Legit question I have no idea.
2041,I think by the time they do it‚Äôs next generation.
2042,Look at Intel trying.
2043,Amd is the competition and if they choose amd that will rocket.
2044,I‚Äôm looking at a sympathetic play with dev conference and nvidia split.
2045,"I do dev work for both independent', 'Msft or google are more like the competition."
2046,Dell.
2047,Apple doesn‚Äôt really have competition in US.
2048,We are locked in.
2049,So whatever the plan it just needs current hardware.
2050,I agree competitive is great.
2051,Love amd for that.
2052,Apple making AI chips is a long strategy.
2053,"They‚Äôd lose like Intel and admit it‚Äôs so hard.', 'But yeah if anyone can do it Apple has money."
2054,"It‚Äôll be interesting and I‚Äôm full port on calls a few weeks out.', 'Ah."
2055,They are making M4 chips.
2056,So nvidia down apple up.
2057,Plans revealed but not in place until 2025.
2058,"Mac rumors', 'I love me some aapls  https://preview.redd.it/d828lnd8o04d1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=437bf46efc75c71bd0f71cec9f48176b124aaa04', ""Only time will tell but I'm seeing 2025 being an AAPL disaster."", 'I mean the dumb thing would be thinking a temporary set back that‚Äôs been fixed is fatal to the company  I bought in that controversy at like 138 or something on google and look where it is now :)', 'Dan Niles has been saying apple will introduce an AI app store."
2059,"What even is that?', 'Many phones were water resistant years ago."
2060,Apple devices still shit the bed if it‚Äôs too humid outside.
2061,They purposely build their phones to break easily because they‚Äôre a hardware company at heart.
2062,"Even the titanium model breaks in your pocket!', '‚ÄúNo one has ever said ‚Äò I‚Äôm going to Bing it‚Äô, except for maybe Bing Crosby announcing he‚Äôs going to masturbate‚Äù  - [John Oliver](https://youtu.be/jXf04bhcjbg?si=06bf0yY8Kky_WlZw)', ""Nah there were so many search engines back then you would just say let me search the web and you'd have a choice between Excite, Lycos, Infoseek, etc..."", ""No...."
2063,"she's sell NVDA in an infinite number of timelines"", 'The guy is living off Wendy‚Äôs dividends in Thailand', 'You had already commented ‚ÄúSo fictional‚Äù What possessed you to come back a day later to say not reading this essay?', 'Why do they hate Nvidia so much?', 'How long have you been holding that?"
2064,"Nicely done sir', 'Define disaster', 'Never said anything was fatal, just that their AI stuff has performed poorly at release fairly consistently."
2065,"Congrats though!', '‚ÄúLet me Excite that real quick‚Äù', 'And uncovered puts', 'üòÇ', 'Without looking up I think nvda screwed up a chip and caused recalls?"
2066,It‚Äôs been bitter.
2067,Thus no confirmation of nvidia chips.
2068,Dunno I‚Äôll look  Edit:  this?
2069,"https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2021/10/13/apple-vs-nvidia-what-happened.html', 'I remember trying to fix these cards with baking."
2070,Wow.
2071,"Way better now.', 'I remember trying to fix these cards with baking."
2072,"Way better now.', 'Couple years but that‚Äôs just my Webull port."
2073,"Own it in E*trade and fidelity as well', 'A starting slide back to 40 cents..', 'CUDA?!?', 'Dad?"
2074,"Is that you?', '![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)', 'https://preview.redd.it/liqdm6ehn14d1.jpeg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74d690704f56de17e1c0ea242ec857dc58fe1421']"
