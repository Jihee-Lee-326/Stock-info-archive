Edit: I’m astounded that it’s so all or nothing.   I would have expected some features to be everywhere while others limited to specific hardware requirements.   Absolutely crazy that an iPhone 15 owner sees all of this and has to contemplate upgrading\\', \"Does that mean Siri is still stupid for those of us who don\\'t have a iPhone 15 Pro?

New Apple TV 4K/HomePod model, M4 chip. Always-on on-demand AI processing, no need to worry about battery life. Continuity with all your apple devices. Act like a mesh router for AI tasks. iPhone makes request, hand off to Apple TV 4K to process over WiFi, returns results/action intents to iPhone. Serves as an edge node to offload compute instead of the private cloud compute feature.   Keeps everything local and private, no need for cloud servers at all. Or just let us use any supported Apple device as an edge node on local network i.e. M4 iPad to older iPhone  Edit: applies to Mac Minis too\\', \\'I loved every single feature *except* the image generation. The \"Genmoji\" looked okay but (ethical issues aside with generating \"art\") the images shown off looked pretty bad on the whole, they had that \"vaselined\" look of certain image generators.

You made a 8 month old device basically “ai obsolete” and didn’t even warn customers.  I evaluated the differences thought iPhone 15 was fine, could have afforded 15 pro but I didn’t see a compelling reason to. Now to be told a huge set of the AI features won’t be available to me. And IMO the AI stuff is the main update in iOS 18…. Kinda dumb\\', \\'The image Generation doesnt look good.

I get it but are we getting anything with ios18?\\', \\'I just noticed this thing is only available on the 15 pro and on… lmao.\\', \\'Honestly part of this sounded like bullshit to me. They were talking about how the cornerstone is on device processing but ‘sometimes’ it would do cloud processing. I wouldn’t be surprised if it turns out that 95% of the requests go to the cloud.  If I could lock it to be on device only I would. It will be interesting to get to use it to see how it handles stuff like being offline.\\', \"I’m concerned. How often will Apple\\'s own AI not be able to fulfill your request and ask ChatGPT for assistance (basically the new let’s search the web) where we know they will harvest your data?\", \"Is this actually Apple\\'s own tech, or are they just paying OpenAI to use theirs?\", \\'They really waited until the last moment to mention ChatGPT. Very curious to see how they integrated it with privacy in mind...\\', \\'I have an iPhone 13P and an M2 MBA.   With the new Mac-to-iPhone continuity feature, could I still use AI iPhone tools like Clean Up if I use my iPhone on my Mac?  Also, will *everything* Craig talked about at the end (everything after MacOS) only be available for iPhone 15P or will some things still be available for everyone\\', \\'“Turn off the automatic sharpening you’re applying to all my photos” — will this work with Apple Intelligence, Craig?\\', \\'Some cool usecases and some questionable ones.

Personally, I did not enjoy watching Google present their Gemini AI for ChromeOS as they put emphasis on the technology itself, rather than on proving it useful in everyday situations. Apple did just the opposite and - without touching on the technological foundation of their AI - showcased a variety of possible use-cases “For the rest of us”. Well done.  I’m genuinely interested to see it in action.\\', \\'Makes no sense to why it isn’t included in the A16 Bionic phones.\\', \\'For whatever reason I just have zero interest in the AI stuff. I live a simple minimal lifestyle and give myself lots of room to think and do things as it is, this seems more for people that listen to 3 podcasts while doing long division as they watch a movie while discussing with friends as you eat dinner. And call me crazy but I also like to sound like myself when I write rather than have a computer tweak up my notes to sound more like someone or something else.   But as long as they let me turn it off easily they can do what they want.\\', \"I mean, it was to be expected that it wouldn\\'t work with older hardware. But supporting only one iPhone generation, and only the Pro model, is... lame. Will take me quite a few years to even try it out.  Except if they thought about it and make it available to older models through Private Cloud Compute. But I got a feeling they didn\\'t think of that. Edit: Nope, they didn\\'t.\", \"I don\\'t know.  The Siri integration and on device stuff is cool.  Contextual awareness of everything on our phone will be very powerful.  Math Notes stuff was amazing and I like these sorts of ML applications.    But then they went on to the image gen stuff, \\'genmoji\\'s\\', and finally revealing just flat out ChatGPT integration.  Some of it is well considered and I think will be useful, but it also feels a bit like they are just throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.  It was almost overwhelming how much they announced.  Apple used to be known for their editorial discretion in terms of design, but this keynote across all of its segments honestly felt like feature overload.  Like too much complexity, in the wrong ways.  Like the Tab Bar thing on iPadOS.\", \"I don\\'t know why but I have a complete revulsion towards this AI generated image shit. I hate that it\\'s coming baked in to iOS.\", \\'Jesus Christ, the AI art looks like fake game app icons\\', \\'I’m fine with a smarter Siri and stuff but I’m not fine with the generated AI images. The fact that generative AI is going to be even more accessible to people than it is already is scary.\\', \"Good thing a lot of it is in device, like the text and image generation. And it\\'s very cohesive among the apps. I wish you could access to chatgpt voice tho but it seems to only give you text when you ask it from Siri. Anyway this AI from apple is very promising.\", \\'So I could be wrong, but is upgraded Siri coming to all devices, but only AI to only iPhone 15 pro and M family devices?\\', \\'Did they mention how to disable it?\\', \\'AI: Apple Intelligence for the rest of us…but only if you have an iPhone 15 Pro.\\', \\'All my Siri does is literally just google things.

Wait and see how they will charge BILLIONS from LLM companies to stay default.\\', \"If they\\'re allowing Apple Intelligence to also make use of Apple servers, why not just allow older iPhones to make use of it within the limits of their NPU\\'s and offload more to the servers?  I know that the answer might be greed and wanting to force people to upgrade, but considering how much people hold on to their old iPhones this will really limit Apple Intelligence\\'s outreach and popularity\", \"I couldn\\'t get the slightest care in the world about AI...why is every company forcing this shit down our throats?!\", \\'It’s cool but ew the design looks like something a child would make\\', \"I guess I\\'ll stick with chatgpt then, lol\", \\'Apple Intelligence **not** on visionOS\\', \"I don\\'t care about the generative features, and I don\\'t trust the summarisation features, but the rest of it...I was a lot more impressed than I thought I was going to be.\", \\'Talking an hour about Apple Intelligence and then restricting it to Iphone 15 Pro is such a bad move.

Booo  I know it’s due to a RAM requirement, but still\\', \\'Super impressed - however, only available on iPhones 15 Pro and Pro Max, plus M-Chip devices.. so no Apple Intelligence for my trusted 13 Pro…\\', \\'So A17 Pro or M1 or newer?

I mean, the worst part of AI is when it generated images by stealing references through all internet... If Apple really made their own model, trained by for example lots of emoji designs made by their team to be able to make you generate the one you would like everything is ok. But if that \"Apple Intelligence\" takes references from everywhere to generate it, that sucks A LOT.

From what I am reading here (haven\\\\\\'t watched the conference) they are using AI to just do basic assistant stuff and be a smarter Siri along with some really basic generative art type stuff to use as message attachments.  Contrast this to the state Google is currently at where they\\\\\\'re using AI to detect if phone calls sound like scams and the caller is trying to lead you into giving away personal information, or how they are working on making it so you can ask \"Show me that photo of me in Paris holding the mint chocolate ice cream\" and it pulls up the photo matching that description form your photo library.  Something currently in the works is being able to just record a video of a leaking tap for example and type a query alongside the video such as \"Why is it doing this and how do I fix it\" and the Gemini AI working out the context and providing a solution to what it sees.  I just feel like Apples take is like the real infancy of AI - like from a few years ago when we first really found out about it and used it for nothing beyond weird computer generated art and asking trivia questions or making a shopping list and such.  It\\\\\\'s like putting it in the phone to tick a check box and keep up with everyone else rather than doing it because there\\\\\\'s some great innovation to be made. There\\\\\\'s also no logical reason why this is being locked behind a £1000 odd device either - just run the information in the cloud and let it be usable by everyone even back to like iPhone 11\\\\\\'s or something and let the super high end current models do some extra advanced on device stuff that\\\\\\'s exclusive and requires no internet connection.\\', \"And.... that\\'s a wrap, folks.

These two models are the only ones with the A17 Pro chipset—the only iPhone chip possessing the raw processing power that Apple Intelligence requires. No, even your iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus won’t cut it. (Those have a version of the A16 chip.)\"\\', \\'QCOM Just got a run for their money with this on device processing.

Totally predictable stuff and honestly felt like Apple was simply playing catch up. Almost every one of their features they announced is already available on another platform.  **Image Playgrounds**: Honestly looks gimmicky AF and missing the Apple \"polish\" that I\\\\\\'d expect. The images generated look just bad. Honestly was shocked that Apple Marketing team OK\\\\\\'d the terrible demos they did in such a high-profile keynote. Looks like a rehash of the crap already available on platforms like Copilot. Uncanny valley stuff that\\\\\\'s stuck in between looking real and fake.  **ChatGPT integration**: This honestly feels like Siri\\\\\\'s 2024 version of \"I found this on the web...\" Feels like Apple just got lazy. With all their talent and cash on hand, couldn\\\\\\'t they have just built their own, secure LLMs to compete with ChatGPT?

Apple talks a big game about doing stuff on device. But they haven’t explained what will and won’t be local.   I bet way more of it will be online than they suggest  This selection of devices ensures that the server side stuff won’t be flooded with billions of requests from day one.

That’s effectively what this was - accidentally finding old pictures that were still marked as “free” but never got overwritten.

Even though the “file” is technically still on the system, it’s now encrypted without a key, so no possible way to decrypt it, even if you had the index.   The parent comment says that it’s possible that the photo was saved to both the photos app and the files app, but it’s hard to say. What definitely didn’t happen though, was the file randomly resurfacing after being marked for deletion.\\', \\'You explain not an article\\', \"Going 8-10 in 10 years, that\\'s pretty good\", \\'[removed]\\', \\'The new iPhone 16 and Plus will be getting A17 Bionic which will be made with 2nd gen 3 nanometer process this will support Apple Intelligence.   It would be pretty stupid to announce a new software that everyone will want to use and then 3 months later release a new product that can’t use the software.   Apple is just keeping all the hardware stuff for the iPhone event under their hat until September.\\', \"Its hardly likely to have anything earlier than an A17. Its not specifically the SOC thats the reason it wouldn\\'t work on the older ones, is the available memory. They could slap 16GB ram in an A16 and it would be enough. It\\'s why the M1 (which is based on the A14) is capable of running it.\", \\'I think it’ll revert to AI and people will say that’s Apple information\\', \\'Not really. On the software side sure, but not on the hardware side. Pixels are basically a rounding error in terms of market share.   Samsung is the bigger competitor in the phone world.\\', \\'I think most of the Apple Intelligence is their own stuff on and off device and that requires the new high RAM iPhone models, while the ChatGPT integration looked more like the current Siri shortcut that everyone can enable already today (and which is pretty neat) but a bit deeper as you can launch it context specifically, or when Siri doesn’t know. I guess we will see soon! I think ChatGPT is getting pretty good now, it’s so much smarter than last year.\\', \\'[deleted]\\', \\'That isn’t a quote from Apple lol reading is oh so hard\\', \\'[deleted]\\', \\'And the people responsible then testified years later that, again, there was no hack. They socially engineered by posing as Apple employees:\\\\xa0https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/29/entertainment/celebrity-photo-hacking-sentence/index.html  Curious how you keep propping up a patently false narrative and gleefully ignored the real scandal with Microsoft that happened mere months ago.\\']'"
