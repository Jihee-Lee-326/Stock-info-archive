3493,2024-05-21 22:39:35,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9905173182487488, Competitors using their platform would be amazing as it would solidify their moat as THE platform which would help them collect additional IP royalties potentially and would ensure their platform is the one companies go for (and need enterprise support for)

3498,2024-05-21 22:39:35,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.998150110244751, The real questions are:  Does TSM and ASML have any real capacity to support a competitor? (They currently really don‚Äôt)  Do the CSPs see any slowing for GPU based resources? (They aren‚Äôt)  When is the growth cycle predicted to slow and get into a maintenance cycle? (This is really the TBD everyone is trying to suss out)  There‚Äôs going to be a fine line between too much capacity and too little capacity
3499,2024-05-21 22:39:35,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9983781576156616, Nvidia understands that very well which is why their software layers are extremely important

8009,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9218623638153076,Basically just the fact that they‚Äôre cheaper

8012,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.8809736371040344,Price is usually better as well.
8013,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9991666078567504,I went from a RTX3070 to 6900XT (3070 was a heavily discounted sale to nephew who lost a GPU)
8014,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9966859221458436,"At 1440p they gave both performed fine, better FPS on 6900XT"
8015,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.994979202747345,RTX was $999 and 6900XT on sale was $909 (AUD).
8016,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9928616881370544,Price mainly I guess? I'd guess that they are more available and cheaper then Nvidia
8017,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.998372495174408,But I've heard that the drivers for them are hell.

8024,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9989563226699828,Because ray tracing is over rated and amd is the better price to preformance brand
8025,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9985418319702148,Otherwise no unless you want to save a buck.
8026,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9985489249229432,I bought a 6650XT because linux drivers are better and it's been great! Most of my audio shut off issues went away
8027,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9994237422943116, Performance is up from my ancient 1050ti as well.
8028,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9924036264419556,I'm using a 1070 single fan card to play destiny 2 on my 38 inch ultrawide
8029,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.996745467185974,If you want to go with a newer card I would say make sure it has more than 8GB of VRAM as that seems to be the baseline these days for newer games
8030,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9696266651153564,But it depends entirely on what you want to play
8031,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9998181462287904,Like I said this card is good enough for what it does for me
8032,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9947760105133056,If I were playing new triple A games I'd personally just go look at benchmarks and see what performance I wanted and stick to a budget.
8033,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9811766743659972,Far better price to performance
8034,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9965184926986694, You can get a 7900 XTX for $200 cheaper than a 4080
8035,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.901880979537964,And the 7900 XTX outperforms the 4080 in every aspect except ray tracing (which you won‚Äôt use) and cuda (which you won‚Äôt use unless you work in the 3D design and rendering space)
8036,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9956680536270142, And not to mention that after around a year or two AMD drivers can add up to 20% more performance than release.
8037,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9817737936973572,AMD takes a major win when it comes to Linux support.

8041,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.993779480457306,Those are pretty much the only two reasons that matter if you don't need to stream or utilize cuda cores for anything
8042,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.98552805185318,"Part of that is changing with AMD supporting the AV1 codec, and Nvidia not, in the most recent cards"
8043,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9883777499198914,"But everyone is overpriced right now, on both sides"

8045,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9894772171974182,I would stick with the 4070ti
8046,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9947625994682312,Pay a bit more but you avoid issues with drivers and you aren‚Äôt buying last gen

8048,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9979071617126464,You also get Ray tracing and dlss which are nice to haves.
8049,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9794524908065796,"Linux support, their open source drivers and their non-hostile positions towards open source software in general compared to NVidia."
8050,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9897144436836244,To answer your post title directly: money
8051,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9962542057037354, AMD typically offer better performance per dollar at the low end where value matters more
8052,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9674049019813538,Take the RTX 3060 vs RX 6650 XT for example: the AMD GPU beats the Nvidia offering by 15% on average while costing around the same amount
8053,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.999763548374176,"At this product tier, ray tracing is basically irrelevant because neither GPU has enough power to get acceptable framerates, so you're better off going with the AMD option for better performance"
8054,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9919286966323853," High-end GPUs can provide a good RT experience, so Nvidia's advantage in that space begins to matter more"
8055,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9336667060852052,"You're also probably using a high resolution monitor with your high-end graphics card, where DLSS will provide greater framerate gains with less degradation of visual fidelity (because you're upscaling from a higher base resolution, giving the AI more information to work with), so this will serve to increase Nvidia's popularity at the high end further"
8056,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9960958361625672," Basically, if you're looking at 50 or 60 class GPUs, AMD have historically offered superior performance per dollar in this space"
8057,2023-03-01 02:25:28,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.864869236946106,"For 80 or 90 class GPUs, Nvidia offers a better feature set that most users don't mind paying a premium for."

If so, higher-end NVIDIA gpus compared to their AMD equivalent often perform better in that regard and both DLSS 2.0 + Frame Gen (3.0) are currently ahead of FSR 2.0 (FSR is still good tho and 3.0 coming soon)  2) Best bang for buck?  Excluding RT and Upscaling from the equation, AMD wins in this regard (obviously comparing equivalents)  3) Durability  Unless you buy the RTX 3060 12GB or something like RTX 3090/4090 with 24GB, NVIDIA biggest dealbreaker is the amount of VRAM they put in their gpus and that may be the #1 thing that'd make your Graphics Card obsolete in newer AAA titles (mostly if you use Ray Tracing)"

12387,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9988585710525512,One final thought: the most recent time I watched this film was my first since becoming a father to young boy like in this film and it‚Äôs certainly changed how I felt while watching it

12944,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9967515468597412,Like David essentially is discovered from his much more advanced descendants and they take pity on him

13065,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.99797922372818,"Artificial Intelligence‚Äô (2001)* examines the key ideas of agency, metamorphosis and faith and patience; all of which are prevalent in Collodi‚Äôs original novel, ‚ÄòThe Adventures of Pinocchio‚Äô"
13066,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9979456067085266,"Spielberg‚Äôs film reflects several aspects of the context of the wider world of 2000s America; whilst challenging typical notions of ecological degradation, purity, racism and prejudice, corporate greed and the widespread disdain for forms of artificial intelligence as a tangible and intellectual presence in the everyday world"
13067,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.5759639143943787,"  The film begins with an ominous shot of a flooding Manhattan, whilst a voiceover explains the global warming epidemic that has possessed the American dystopia"
13068,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9904394149780272,"Spielberg makes use of prolonged, lingering establishing shots, in combination with periods of eerie silence so as to sufficiently mirror the loss of humanity that permeated America of the future, directly challenging the responder with a call for action ‚Äì lest their world descends into a secluded, flooded ruin"
13069,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9970346689224244,"Spielberg, as such, directly poses the moral imperative of agency to the responder; beckoning them to a wider responsibility, through the threat of severe ecological degradation"
13070,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9914606809616088,Spielberg makes use of a bleak colour palette in the very same opening shot ‚Äì a palette which is sustained throughout the ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù phase of the film ‚Äì to enhance the undercurrent of despair and isolation that is mirrored in the very words that seem to praise that of which is so removed from the livelihood of humanity; ‚Äúrobots who were never hungry‚Ä¶ were so essential and economically in the chain mail of society‚Äù
13071,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.6964833736419678,"When analysing the underlying theme of ecological degradation as a byproduct of human neglect, it is evident that the entire film is tinged with an impending sense of nihilism; in a slight divergence from Collodi‚Äôs original core text"
13072,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9938595294952391,Spielberg deepens the theme of nihilism by using the same Manhattan setting as a place of deep symbolism later in the film in David‚Äôs attempted suicide
13073,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9941107630729676,"This use of the recurring setting (in this case, acting as a motif for the lack of humanity) serves to provide a stark contrast to David‚Äôs uncovering of his true humanity moments after his jump into the flood ‚Äì as it is only after he goes past the ‚Äòpermanence‚Äô of the surface of the ruin does he uncover the true ‚ÄòBlue Fairy‚Äô who offers him redemption and ultimate humanity"
13074,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9995619654655457,"Hence, Spielberg makes effective use of the many elements of the mise en scene, in tandem with the implementation of certain imagery and symbolism so as to make clear the themes of isolation and a loss of humanity, derived from the contextual concern of global warming and ecological degradation"
13075,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9989540576934814, The film also tackles the theme of metamorphosis and purity in a slightly different manner than Collodi‚Äôs novel
13076,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9578266143798828,"David is portrayed (quite ironically) as a naive all-knowing robot, who longs to become sentient after connecting with his human mother"

13078,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.999207317829132,"Spielberg yet again uses several elements of the mise en scene to explore David‚Äôs innocence throughout the film; most notably, through the lighting and colour of the set"
13079,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9757227897644044,"For instance, David is first shown dressed in pure white, not only symbolising his purity but his rigid, bland programmed-self, in the eyes of the Creator and his parents"
13080,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.5061936378479004,"However, when David enters Giglio‚Äôs fantastical neon-tinged world and the Flesh Fair, his attire changes to that of dark wear, tinged with red"
13081,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9997097849845886,"In doing this, Spielberg conveys to the responder the sheer transformative power of the harsh world (that of which he has already established through the exploration of textual concerns like global warming and population decrease), mirroring Collodi‚Äôs poignant message in the original tale"
13082,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9974485039711,"Spielberg also ensures to depict David frequently in front of blue-tinged circular rim lights, resembling that of traditional halos in many different settings ‚Äì namely his bedroom, which serves as the cornerstone for his love of humans"

13084,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9974291920661926,"This rebirth through purity, whilst seemingly unattainable throughout the film, is finally revealed to David after he goes back for one day to his mother; dying in the process"
13085,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9797073602676392,"This resolve, whilst initially disconcerting, is accentuated by the extremely bright tones and the excessive saturation, again, used to signify David‚Äôs purity in rebirth"
13086,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.999605119228363,"Therefore, Spielberg provides the responder with a vastly different notion of the archetypal rebirth in the form of rebirth through maintaining ones‚Äô innocence, serving as an effective commentary on his world of the time, and more closely resembling the original tale by portraying the harshness of the world around him"

13090,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.976249098777771,This notion is first established by The Creator when he poses a rhetorical question to a doubter of his technology; ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt God create Adam to love Him?‚Äù Spielberg includes this Biblical allusion of Adam and Eve so as to reference their rejection of redemption ‚Äì posing a significant parallel to the story of David with an alternative outcome
13091,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9959140419960022,"Not only does this automatically provide to the responder an appropriate precedent for the story, but it also directly poses the question of spiritual belief to them, in an age where the rise in non-believers was conflated with the uprise in logical thinking; a byproduct of the robotic evolution"
13092,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9854816198349,"This concern gave life to the fear of A.I and machinery and its integration in human life; in particular, machines who mimic human intellect and reasoning"

13099,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.990151584148407,"In this way, it acts as a wider metaphor within the context of the film, by illuminating the inhumanity and detrimental effects of racism and other forms of real-world prejudice (as the abuse of the androids signify real human inequality)"
13100,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9824803471565248,"This further ties into the swell of corporate greed that affected America in the 2000s, as the onlookers take pleasure in throwing money to see the robots being abused"

There is also the concept of the uncanny valley"
13111,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9997904896736144,Extremely important in this film

13128,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9990923404693604,"However, over the years, and especially now with many films considering the concept of androids such as Ex-Machina, the film has garnered some cult followings in the science fiction enthusiast rings"
13129,2020-11-07 13:27:15,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9996278285980223,It very properly illustrates concepts of artificial intelligence and that of consciousness as a creation

What about drugs? Drug-induced euphoria can be physically and chemically no different than a natural way of achieving it

Someone with severe delusions might experience happiness over something that's truly detrimental to themselves or others, is that meaning?  A subjective point of view on meaning therefor we must conclude has some problems, as subjectivity is inherently immeasurable and itself subject to change and reevaluation and manipulation, and therefore could be argued to be entirely arbitrary"

18747,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9886305332183838,  I've always liked my Clears more for games not only due to the tuning but since the bass is more present it makes it easier to hear what's going on and alerts you of the direction of danger better.

18755,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.962466299533844, Also the game's audio engine does much of the heavy lifting when it comes to in game audio so the type of audio listening device matters but doesn't determine if you're gonna hear your enemies or not
18756,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9889593124389648,I‚Äôd take the JBL Quantum One and its head-tracking surround technology over these any day.

18837,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.8928219676017761,Bought them 2-3 months ago
18838,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.7624720335006714,Absolutely no idea
18839,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9996082186698914,It was some cheap lavalier mic I got from Amazon lol
18840,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9714884161949158,Yeah but at a 6th of the cost lol
18841,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9762129783630372,Nope not an issue
18842,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9925861954689026,First of all I don‚Äôt listen to high volumes and secondly open backs don‚Äôt leak sound as if they‚Äôre speakers
18843,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.999071717262268,Sure when standing next to someone wearing them and you try to hear what he‚Äôs listening to you can pick it up but it‚Äôs nowhere as loud for a mic to pick the noise up especially not within normal listening levels
18844,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.6537184715270996,Yeah that‚Äôs an issue‚Ä¶ but there are really good closed backs options too like noirs
18845,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9960861206054688,Didn‚Äôt like them tho
18846,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9997727274894714,"Too much clamp, pads too hard, shape of the pads was really bad in distributing the clamping force‚Ä¶"
18847,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9819396138191224,Yeah I have 2 setups
18848,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9884732365608216,My main one has a SM7B as a mic but this is my second setup which does not have a separate mic
18849,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.998727023601532,The old clip broke tho so I thought about a different solution and this was it lol
18850,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.8634647727012634,And that‚Äôs where EQ comes in
18851,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9972049593925476, I have clears myself and while I completely agree that their tonality is superior the lack the PinPoint accurate imaging the 800 S have
18852,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.924269199371338, They have way better vertical imaging and they also present the 180 degree ‚Äûbehind you‚Äú better
18853,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9253377914428712, I EQ bass into the 800 S
18854,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.99904865026474,depending on the game I EQ them to Harman to make their soundstage smaller
18855,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9780852794647216, So yeah Stock the clears sound better but with EQ the 800 s are way way better for gaming imo
18856,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9992913007736206,Yet no EQ will give the 800 s the punch the clears have
18857,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9921814203262328, Also: most reviewers saying soundstage makes a good gaming headset have no idea what they are talking about
18858,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9996700286865234, Too little stage and they sound too closed in
18859,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9998090863227844,Too large stage and the imaging and depth perception suffers
18860,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9938511848449708,The clears for me tend to have almost too little stage (but still enough)
18861,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.992550492286682,Clears (and radiance) problem is the imaging especially when something is behind you
18862,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.992149829864502, But everyone hears different and a headphone that works for one person might not work for another
18863,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.5723796486854553,Some games have a built in add Bass feature
18864,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9901019334793092, COD Warzone has one.
18865,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9997541308403016,"If you aren‚Äôt EQing any headphone, you‚Äôre missing 1/2 your headphone experience"
18866,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9619883894920348,"I purchased my 800 S‚Äôs after hearing my friends pair, EQ‚Äôd"
18867,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9973082542419434,"When I got mine, I listened to them without EQ and the high end was literally painful"
18868,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9992865920066832,"As soon as EQ‚Äôd, they were the best headphone I‚Äôve had yet."
18869,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9981181621551514,I really like the 800 s for competitive gaming too
18870,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9686448574066162,I add bass for better awareness of steps and other sound clues
18871,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9997790455818176,My xenns top are also quite good for gaming.
18872,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9990642666816713,Ie900 have good sound stage?  I have ie600 and they suck for gaming because lacking sound stage
18873,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9859206080436708,I agree to some points tho you can easily reduce the 800 s stage with EQ
18874,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9613656997680664, When using oratory‚Äôs presets the stage of the 800 s gets smaller while not losing their imaging
18875,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9857107996940612,"I tried many headphones and while you‚Äôre completely right that the width of those cans throws them off, I am yet to find another headphone that has the same great imaging"
18876,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9670491814613342, My second favourite would be 1990 pro or xenns top
18877,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9994757771492004, And what‚Äôs best is almost always subjective
18878,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9965531826019288,Yet the joke of the post was that the 800 s are not a headset
18879,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9921362400054932,I turned them into one
18880,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.8274886012077332,I mean the joke itself was that the 800 s aren‚Äôt a headset but I made it one lol
18881,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9871782064437866, What are your recommendations tho?
18882,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9936566948890686,Yeah the stock 800 s are really really bright‚Ä¶ they just lack the bass to balance the treble and that makes them quite fatiguing imo
18883,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.999749720096588, But with a good bass shelf they are really nice
18884,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9883607625961304,I am still thinking of buying Aryas but hifiman QC is scaring me off tbh
18885,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9995518326759338,Thank you! Lol the shp 9500 with boom mic was also my first pair that got me started
18886,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9976720213890076,The 1990 pros are great tho and get extremely close to the 800 s imaging
18887,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.990958571434021, I switch between those two from time to time because both sound quite different
18888,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9981003403663636, The mic is a cheap 10‚Ç¨ lavalier mic from Amazon
18889,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9987668991088868,I use some EQ on it and my friends say it sound great lol
18890,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9994238615036012,Thank you! Yeah those puppies are expensive and probably not worth the extra cost but their imaging is the best I had so far
18891,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.8054753541946411,Tho you need to add bass to enjoy them imo
18892,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9988607168197632,Yea I didn‚Äôt want to spend a ton of money for a modmic since I already have the lavalier mic
18893,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.99065500497818,Also then entire thing weighs 12g with the mic so it‚Äôs not like it adds a ton of weight.
18894,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9923205971717834,Maybe when I‚Äôm done refining it :)
18895,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.99834144115448,>STL  So I made the final version and its avaiale for free at [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/583526-hd-800-s-headset-mod-boom-arm)
18896,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9959753155708312,Yeah they are actually really good with EQ but I can‚Äôt stand them without lol
18897,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9983862638473512,I have a SM7B on my other setup but this is my second PC which does only have this lavalier mic
18898,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9963077306747437,What mic are you using?
18899,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9941450953483582,I play shooters 90% of my time too lol
18900,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9871166348457336, While I agree that IEMs are great too I would say they are better than over ears for them
18901,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.99781596660614, It also depends quite heavily on the IEMs and headphones we‚Äôre talking about and the game itself
18902,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9997064471244812,Sadly I don‚Äôt have any akg headphone so I can‚Äôt do anything for you :(
18903,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9891419410705566,"Didn‚Äôt try lcds yet but for gaming the 800 s is way better than clears, tho I prefer the clears stock tonality."
18904,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.999309778213501,Nah this headset is absolutely fine
18905,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9894379377365112,It‚Äôs also just 2-3 months old lol
18906,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9997074007987976," The dent you see is just a optical illusion, I went to check and it‚Äôs completely fine"
18907,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9662906527519226, I replaced the headband with a Beyerdynamic one and covered it with the fabric cover to make it more comfy
18908,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.988524854183197,"I can‚Äôt tell you, Since I never had an audeze headphone."
18909,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9987940788269044,I have a SM7B on my other setup but as this is my second rig I only have the lavalier mic
18910,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.98887038230896,The old clamp broke so this is the new solution
18911,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9978132247924804,And as this is plastic I don‚Äôt think it will scratch anything lol
18912,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.999653697013855,Yeah but you can EQ it and reduce the stage this makes them quite versatile for gaming
18913,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9981866478919984,This hobby isn‚Äôt about ‚Äûenough‚Äú
18914,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9969326257705688,You could argue that the cheap earbuds that came with my Mate 20 pro back then are enough
18915,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9954845905303956,They play sound and give an idea of imaging
18916,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.5592507123947144,Would it be enough? Sure
18917,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9983935952186584,Is there better alternatives? Sure.
18918,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.987536609172821,I use either an element III or my mayflower ark mk II
18919,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9981396198272704,Well my PC is somewhat loud but I don‚Äôt really mind tbh.
18920,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.999863862991333,This mic is surprisingly good
18921,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.8664006590843201,Especially if you apply some EQ
18922,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.998751163482666,My friends asked me what mic I got and how expensive it was and they don‚Äôt believe me when I tell them it‚Äôs a 10‚Ç¨ lavalier mic from Amazon lmao
18923,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9804343581199646,It‚Äôs from a company called nyfter

18927,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,POSITIVE,0.9995630383491516,Okay that‚Äôs a new one for me
18928,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9975964426994324,Nah first I have to refine it and make them fit better
18929,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9993404746055604,After that I‚Äôll probably just upload the STL file for people to print it themselves

18934,2023-09-15 04:39:55,NVDA,NEGATIVE,0.9993115663528442,Maybe but 80 of players that rek me in cod are blatantly cheating lol
