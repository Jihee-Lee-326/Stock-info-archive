60,"Always enjoy your videos. Thanks! I watch a lot on option plays and your updates are some of the best.  Question... with this MSFT trade, if such a bullish position by smart $, why not go the opposite direction and put on a vertical put? For example, 11/15 expiration and being conservative sell $385 strike put and buy $365 strike put? If the stock moves in a positive direction, the puts will decay in value and we keep all the premium. This eliminates the risk of MSFT not increasing in value by over 10% by 11/15. MSFT would have to drop by almost 15% for the vertical put not to work. Seems less risky with a healthy reward. Thoughts?",NEGATIVE,0.8832781314849854
