49,"Apple‚Äôs strategy is quite confusing. It feels like they just released the M3-powered MacBook, and now they‚Äôre launching the M4-powered iPad Pro. It seems a bit early for the M4 on the iPad. Moreover, the design of the iPad Pro is too thin. After switching to an OLED panel, the extra space should have been used to double the battery capacity, aligning better with the productivity-focused positioning of the Pro product line.

61,"Two additional tips:<br><br>1. With the current remote, clicking on the Right or Left arrows of the navigation ring will skip the content forward or backward.  The amount it moves depends on the app.  For instance, YouTubeTV skips 15 seconds with each click.<br><br>2.

65,"One feature you missed which is a must have for me is the Match Content option in the video settings. If that is on and your TV is compatible it streams video at the frame rate and resolution of the content, otherwise the Apple TV converts it to whatever your Apple TV is set to. <br><br>If you have a mix of content, for example movies at 24 frames a second, UK and North American TV shows which have different frame rates everything streams without annoying jitters, which can be really obvious on panning shots for example.<br><br>Many of the apps honour the setting too, so Netflix and Plex will match. The main exception is the YouTube app that resolutely converts everything to the overarching setting of the Apple TV.",NEGATIVE,0.9551824331283569
66,"A vital setting to turn on is &#39;match content&#39; in the video and audio settings, turn that on for frame rate and HDR.  It then instructs the TV to alter frame rate and turn on/off HDR based on the content you are watching for smooth playback.",POSITIVE,0.9883711934089661

69,Excellent and informative introduction to the Apple TV 4K. A couple of things that I particularly like about this steaming box that you didn‚Äôt mention is the scrolling feature to quickly and accurately fast forward or reverse on many of the apps. <br><br>I also think the ability to switch quickly and easily between various different apps is another big benefit of the ATV4K box and provides much greater flexibility than using the built in apps on a smart tv or an Amazon fire stick for example where you have to completely exit one app before accessing another.,POSITIVE,0.9989105463027954
