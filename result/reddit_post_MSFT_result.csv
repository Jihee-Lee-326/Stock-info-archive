If the contracts you bought and sold were of equal in amount then the profits you could make would be limited to the difference in the strike prices??? Am i right?

295,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9947422742843628,"no, because the broker will exercise the long calls, resulting in $20\*100 per contract profit"
296,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9826244711875916,this is the whole point of a vertical spread: to cap exposure in exchange for capping gain potential.

299,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9942968487739564,Actually if MSFT goes above 400 he is net long 90 calls @ 380 with no cap on the upside

309,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.998458743095398,So you‚Äôll collect $10.60 per contract sold and $20 per contract (ish) on the first 110 calls and maybe another $35 on the other 90?  I could be way off though lol

323,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9966180920600892, If his short calls get assigned he'll have a bunch of shares shorted and if he's got enough margin it will just stay that way.

338,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9692886471748352,They aren‚Äôt capping the 200 calls.
339,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9985931515693665,I chickened out of MSFT and i dont blame you
340,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9989184141159058,I thought MSFT was gonna drop like META so i stayed out.
341,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9944207072257996,The 110 calls that had the 110 calls sold against them will be worth $20 (remember avg cost of all of the 200 buy to open calls is about $15 when you take into consideration the credit he received from the premiums collected on the sold calls)
342,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9962399005889891,The 90 contracts left don‚Äôt have a cap on profit as they didn‚Äôt have calls sold against them
343,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9800065159797668,They‚Äôll be worth the difference of $380 and the current stock price
344,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.98470276594162,So if msft stays at $415 they‚Äôre worth $35 + a tad of time value as they don‚Äôt expire until 5/10
345,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9961284399032592,"  If Msft is $415 $35 - $15 cost = $20 profit x 9,000 shares = $180,000 $20 - $15 cost = $5 profit x 11,000 shares = $55,000 Which equals $235,000 in gains if Msft is at $415  Roughly, time value not taken into consideration"
346,2024-04-26 01:23:59,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9968817234039308,Few more variables that go into this as buying the sold calls back if wanting to close the 110 contract spread out early etc etc
