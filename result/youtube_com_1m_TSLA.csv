1,We need a sunroof back on the model s and X,NEGATIVE,0.9981505274772644
2,"I still own a 2017 Model X I bought new.  Never been to service center.  Only maintenance have been tires.  I charge at home with solar.  Save $500/month on gas and home electricity.  No more oil filters in landfills every 5000 miles.  No petrochemical odors in cabin.  I recently bought another Tesla, a Model Y.  Transferred FSD from X to Y.  Wow, FSD has really improved.  Definitely a level 3 with minimal intervention needed.  I just moved to a new city.  It‚Äôs a game changer navigating in new surroundings",POSITIVE,0.9925904273986816
3,I could be remembering wrong but i think trump said he would end the &quot;mandate&quot; on day one. The EV mandates are not the insensitive from the inflation reduction act. Honestly ending the mandates would kind of do nothing so who cares.,NEGATIVE,0.9670722484588623
4,Video says Trump is saying he&#39;ll remove the tax credits.  That&#39;s incorrect he said the mandate to have all electric cars (no other choices like ICE cars for Americans).  He&#39;s not said he&#39;s removing the current tax credits.,NEGATIVE,0.9969887137413025

11,My 2020 Model Y lease return went horribly. I will never lease a car that you can‚Äôt buy at lease end.,NEGATIVE,0.9996651411056519
12,The prices you‚Äôre using don‚Äôt include taxes and fees which bump the Model 3 Perf for example up an extra $200/mo from what the site shows and numbers you used.,NEGATIVE,0.9955112934112549
13,"I have been leasing for the last 10 years and 3 of them have been with Tesla. The thing I like about leasing is a new car every 3 years and don‚Äôt have to own something that depreciates in value. The miles thing is the worst part but I always do the 15000 a year and seems to work good for me. As far as buying at the end of the lease you can only do that with the models S &amp; X,. I am on my second model 3 so I will not have the option to buy. When I did my credit app online it was instant approval, didn‚Äôt have to wait at all. I did Tesla insurance and it‚Äôs pretty cheap. I got the new 2024 model 3 performance and had to put down $6000. The first Tesla was a 2021 model three performance and had to put down $5000. My payment actually went down from last time. It‚Äôs was $781 for the 2021 and now it‚Äôs $741 for the 2024 a month. I have solar on my roof at home that covers all the electricity charges even charging the car. So in my opinion, for me, leasing is an amazing option.",NEGATIVE,0.6828061938285828
14,All things equal. You are paying the depreciation plus associated admin cost of the vehicle in a lease.,POSITIVE,0.9914975762367249
15,"Another downside for leasing a Telsa is when you return the car, they will charge for a wear and tear fee which is from low $3000 to over $5000 USD, that really keeps me away from leasing one.",NEGATIVE,0.991827130317688
16,We are arriving at a point in time when things may change RAPIDLY in the EV sector. FSD robotaxis may become the better choice over buying a vehicle in the next 5-10 years. EVs might become substantially cheaper in the next 2-5 years. Leasing might be a way to ride the wave until the transportation situation sorts itself out and a new norm emerges.,NEGATIVE,0.9887318015098572
17,The thing about leasing a Model Y is that you‚Äôre very likely getting stuck with the LG battery since leases aren‚Äôt subject to domestic battery sourcing requirements. Would have been nice if Ryan addressed that.,NEGATIVE,0.9981088638305664
18,I leased one car in my life time  when i turned it in  they made me  pay for new tires. They said the ones on were worn  which i highly disagreed. It felt like i lost my car and got nothing in return. I much prefer buying...,NEGATIVE,0.998467743396759
19,"I bought a used 2022 Model 3 for $18,900 after the Federal Rebate, and I own it outright. The lease for the RWD Model 3 might make the most financial sense if you want to drive a brand-new car, but you are limited to 10,000 miles. So, if you drive a lot, you cannot recoup your investment in gas savings. It would be interesting to see how much the trade-in value is after the lease is completed.  <br><br>I figured that the money I invested to purchase my 2022 Model 3 actually is earning about 8% annually in gas savings. This ROI is guaranteed so long as I don&#39;t have an accident or the car breaks down. Since the Model 3 is perhaps the most reliable EV made, I don&#39;t foresee it breaking down. I also calculated that if I drive the car for approximately 18000 - 20,000 miles, it will have paid for itself in gas savings, using $4.00 per gallon as a metric. This does not include savings on oil changes, brake changes, fluid replacements and other ICE maintenance cost savings. I also own a 4-wheel Drive Toyota. It gets about 15 mpg in the city, so I save a ton of money on gas in comparison.<br><br>If I drive this Model 3 for more than 20,000 miles, it will be paying me to own it as opposed to driving my Tacoma. This is an almost guaranteed financial return of 8%, and that ROI is hard to find right now unless you take significant risks.",NEGATIVE,0.9963231086730957

43,That statistic is meaningless unless you know the proportion of total population traded. If 5% of Tesla owners trade with a dealer and 50% choose ICE then 2.5% of Tesla owners are reverting to ICE. Not that high really? Bear in mind you would not be at a dealership if you were swapping to another Tesla (as most do). My guess is those people had financial difficulties and needed to lower their repayments by swapping to a cheap ICE car. ü§î,NEGATIVE,0.9997209906578064
44,"Everyone is absolutely misunderstanding what Edmunds is saying. Read what they are saying here carefully: <br>&quot;More than half of Teslas traded in at dealerships so far in 2024 were traded in for a gas vehicle.&quot; Note that Tesla doesn&#39;t have dealerships or gas cars to trade. <br><br>So here is what that means. A survey done by Bloomberg in the US recently: &quot;Tesla still maintains an 87% brand retention rate, outperforming two non-electric automakers at 67% with Lexus and 54% at Toyota. 81% of prospective Tesla buyers are new customers switching from competing EV brands compared to 42% of Nissan‚Äôs prospective buyers.&quot;<br><br>Not a small detail that people are misunderstanding here. Teslas traded in at legacy dealerships are a small percentage of overall Teslas being traded in. So the 13% of non-loyal Tesla customers traded in at legacy dealerships and are trading in for legacy dealership gas cars with the other half being traded in for legacy dealership EVs. This is a smaller subset of used Teslas being traded in. The other 87% is being traded in for new Teslas. So if Tesla has a 87% loyalty rate for returning customers that means that the other 13% are being traded in at legacy dealerships half of which are traded in for legacy EVs. That means only around 7.5% of used Teslas are traded in for ICEs.  <br><br>So Edmunds needs to correct this and change their headline to: Out of the 13% of Teslas that aren&#39;t traded back into Tesla for a new Tesla, 50% of those are traded in for a gas car. But that wouldn&#39;t create as much hysteria and get as many clicks.",NEGATIVE,0.9990131855010986
45,"Edmund‚Äôs data is probably deeply biased. I imagine they‚Äôre only looking at dealership data, which would skew the data towards ICE. Legacy makers don‚Äôt offer many good EVs, so if a Tesla is being traded at a dealership, it would make sense that it‚Äôs traded for something on the lot.",NEGATIVE,0.9994670748710632
46,I could never go back to an ICE car after owning a Model 3 for 6 years.  It would be interesting to know about these folks trading their Tesla for ICE.  Apartment dwellers?

It will be a while before Tesla start including local data for their drives. Until then, drivers will be critical.
