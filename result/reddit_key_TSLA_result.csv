7395,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.99850594997406,"yes and those are pure profit, so as a percentage of net profit, the credits are HUGE."

7402,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9996711015701294,"Plus, this is the company that spent 5 years developing a flawed fake truck from a PS1 game rather than updating their aged models and releasing an affordable model and a normal truck."

7405,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.8599915504455566,So it’s more likely a little of both.
7406,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9973047971725464,They are not a car company they are an AI company
7407,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9968059062957764,Musk’s behavior is certainly part of the problem but I think the Tesla lineup is a more serious issue for the company’s long-term health then whatever the guy says on X
7408,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9992890357971193,"The vast majority of Tesla’s sales are just two vehicles: M3 and MY, both of which are now aging rapidly compared to what the growing competition in the EV space has to offer"
7409,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9984373450279236,"They have no new mass market vehicles arriving in the immediate future, so their only real strategy is to keep slashing prices to inflate demand, which cuts into their profit margins significantly"

7411,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9998121857643129,"So long story short, they’re on a downward trajectory and any sort political change on Musk’s end will not be enough to solve their problems."
7412,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9926723837852478,He's pretty much the mascot of tesla
7413,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.997378945350647,Imagine Ronald Mcdonald or Mickey Mouse talking shit about their core audience.
7414,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9498886466026306,It’s likely a mixture of both
7415,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9991925358772278,  Elon is harming the company with his public outcry’s of insanity
7416,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9961860775947572,  But the cars aren’t helping the brand anymore

7418,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.997761368751526,Especially with a lot more competition coming into the market and giving consumers a real choice of evs
7419,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9879887104034424,They can now get the same or better mileage for around the same cost and the car is built to higher specs
7420,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9954196214675904,  Add in the death spiral they are putting themselves in with offering financing at 1.99% while interest rates are around 7%
7421,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995997548103333,They don’t have the free cash flow to front the cost of all the financing and are likely having to borrow money at market rates to meet these financing deals
7422,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9982115030288696,"So they are selling less cars and the ones they are selling, it’s costing them more to sell."
7423,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.999777615070343,The cars were never particularly good
7424,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9909588098526,  And that was when they were released a decade ago.
7425,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9980453252792358,And the fact that the MAGA ceo looted like 20 million from company shares to turn into 5 million in Twitter value (40 million overall to like 12 million)  And then pulled a Mona lisa and demanded another 40 million for losing so much money
7426,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9915314316749572,Well it's definitely a little bit the Cybertruck..
7427,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9993658661842346,Cybertruck rollout being a colossal clusterfuck surely hasnt helped.
7428,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9632357358932496,Could be both
7429,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9938887357711792,I test drove a Model 3 the other day
7430,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9998379945755004,It seems like a great car
7431,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9994550347328186,  Can't bring myself to buy one though because I don't want to support their boneheaded CEO
7432,2024-07-24 06:13:52,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9816552400588988,I truly wonder how they'd be doing if Elon just left

16551,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.984704852104187,Also think about what a powerfull device you got instead

16553,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9994916915893556,It's mainly an improvised conclusion I ended up after a pot of desperate experimentation with watch 4 whose battery is bad even when things are ok
16554,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.999409556388855,I think it's an issue strictly on wear os side that causes it to behave chaotically
16555,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9897425174713136,(Besides a few relatively hungry apps).
16556,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9991664886474608,I mean if your battery doesn't last a day it's maybe not closing quick enough
16557,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.988260805606842, But even so there is sometimes stuff which just runs in the background
16558,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9991576671600342,Maybe your watch is constantly searching for your phone or for wifi or what not.
16559,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.984197437763214,It’s been a few months

16564,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9988963603973388,Shit I was rooting for you (and myself) that this would work after reading most of the comments.    I was about to factory reset my device but if there's no improvement I won't go through the hassle
16565,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9989578723907472,Plus I have no backup because the smart switch app was too invasive privacy wise.

16567,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.999064028263092,Could be but not necessarily.  Watchfaces can use more power if they have more complications but not normally much more.  Try switching to a stock watchface just in case it makes a difference but I suspect it's the update that's causing your issues.
16568,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995912909507751,And I was told to disable Google's improve location accuracy
16569,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9997630715370178,So it's meaningless to turn it off to save power when it's connected to the phone?
16570,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9479263424873352,Yeah I had good battery just before the update..
16571,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995875954627992,Should i factory reset?
16572,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.7754730582237244,But not a third smaller
16573,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.99943608045578,"Actually no, it is a watch problem since advertised battery is 40 hours and not 24, so it is expected from the watch to behave as advertised."
16574,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9895830154418944,Brightness is auto and I still don't use nfc.
16575,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9994630217552184,"Well now my watch lasts around 40 hours and I've done absolutely nothing since then, I guess it's just some update that messes it up, but I usually get it fixed now by wiping the cache partition"
16576,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9856810569763184,If you have time and patience to deal with setting up the watch again because your battery has been bad for a long time I'd recommend it there's nothing to lose except time.
16577,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9929359555244446,"It connects to the phone using *Bluetooth*, so turning off wi-fi on the watch will save battery."
16578,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.993514895439148,I hate resetting devices cous implies to much work.maybe give it more time and try to measure with pen and paper the real life
16579,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.6999887228012085,Also see what's eating the battery
16580,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9912137389183044,For is the google assistant that takes about 20% which I almlst never use.
16581,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9970692992210388,I created a backup and then did a factory reset and restored backup and mine went from 30 hours back to 3 days
16582,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.999115526676178,YMMV but it was worth it to me IMO.
16583,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9991757273674012,I'm not sure exactly how different the batteries are I just know they aren't the same size
16584,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.994331955909729,My battery life was like a day and a half for the first couple weeks then it settled on this
16585,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9895193576812744,I stand uncorrected
16586,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9731429219245912,My brightness is at 50%
16587,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.99622642993927,Maybe turn off that auto brightness? Maybe its maxed out under the sun when the screen is on
16588,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995381832122804,Thanks for the advice.    I've cleared the cache partition twice in the past and it didn't seem to do anything for me.
16589,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9883595705032348,"Seems like a pretty good idea tbh, might even do the same..."
16590,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9994462132453918,"That's good, maybe some apps build to much cache memory that also affect battery."
16591,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9997054934501648,"I will keep it at 25% indoors and will experiment with outdoor brightness, thanks."
16592,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.574963390827179,"I had that problem, too, but after doing factory reset and later again reset cache partition, I have no issues"
16593,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9993245601654052,"One thing that would bring back a bad battery is updating playstore apps, which I decided not to do for some time."
16594,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9983262419700624,I found factory resetting and restoring a backup a lot easier than going through each individual app to clear the memory cache IMO
16595,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9988000392913818,The only reason I went that route
16596,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9931623935699464,"I do this maybe monthly now, my GW6 43mm Classic retains around 3ish days battery life."
16597,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.98602956533432,It's just mind boggling that they have all these issues with optimization but have no problem churning out another model. One step closer to this model being ignored.    Like my galaxy s20 all of a sudden can't do fast charging with USB-c
16598,2024-04-14 14:16:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9701087474822998,"I can fast charge with a USB-a, and I can super fast charge with USB-c"

20684,2024-04-03 23:02:28,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9105437397956848, And he got into heated exchanges on line with some very smart people in the urban planning space who were genuinely attempting to explain why his proposals were absolute nonsense and could never work

24204,2024-07-26 00:32:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9962749481201172,Arketamine is potentially better at creating longterm change in the brain as it has more of the glutamatergic effects
24205,2024-07-26 00:32:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9822668433189392,The nasal version is esketamine which is being shown to be one of the most effective treatments for emergency mental health scenarios

24210,2024-07-26 00:32:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9952776432037354,However it is much more intense than the nasal sprays

24212,2024-07-26 00:32:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9670888781547546,The prevailing theory is that  glutamatergic affects are the ones desired as glutamate is very good at creating plasticity in the brain

24611,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9996836185455322,"Also, ingress and egress is a lot worse due to the roof height and slope than, for instance, the Model 3"
24612,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.945334792137146,They could work on that
24613,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9996238946914672, I suspect that the S design will have to be changed to accommodate larger battery cell sizes anyway

25564,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9927061200141908, I believe their current pricing for S/X makes the base models effectively the 3/Y “Plus” models.
25565,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9998270869255066,right

25584,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9979426264762878,   The primary reason we are buying a new 2023 MYP (instead of a new 2023 MYLR) is that with inventory discounts they are basically the same price right now
25585,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9947998523712158, IMO it’s a no-brainer to get the MYP at this price.
25586,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9668084383010864,as it will have slightly better resale value and it comes with the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S4 tires which are rated #1 overall in their category

25591,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.996615469455719,I will say the the acceleration of the regular LR Model S is absolutely insane

25593,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.5505797863006592,   I’ve also rented a Plaid X last year and drove it about 700 miles.

25600,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9863661527633668,But at the time the S cost more than EVs from Mercedes and bmw
25601,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995715022087096,"Just couldn’t justify the price given the finishes were basically the same as the Y, which was already quite lacking for a (at the time) $60k-70k vehicle."

25605,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995664954185486,But not quite enough to pull the trigger
25606,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9965693950653076," And now that Highland is out, we know what features the 3/Y have/will have that will likely never come to the S"
25607,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9988464117050172,"  It feels like every year that goes by, post refresh, the S/X fall behind in tech parity"
25608,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.994031012058258,So I can't justify making a commitment to one as each month goes by.

25614,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.986636221408844,Of course that comes with a price.
25615,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9973512887954712,That comparison would work if the iPad was more expensive than an iPhone.

25621,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9968572854995728, So it’s Y & 3 for us
25622,2024-01-03 20:45:42,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.998961329460144, I understand why garages built into the house vs behind the house became popular…garages behind the house are just awkward and take up a lot of your backyard & can prevent purchases of hybrid Panamera or Model S

26125,2024-01-11 00:50:33,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9902212619781494,The X would be a better option for you if you’re concerned about your back
26126,2024-01-11 00:50:33,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9992684721946716,I would test drive both at a service center before pulling the trigger.

26139,2024-01-11 00:50:33,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9846115708351136,then leasing is a better option
26140,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9973576664924622,Wondering if a retrofit from the old design is possible although I’m doubtful
26141,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.997753918170929,"This should have been the wheel from the start of the S refresh, I still can’t believe I have no center horn on my X and it has been a pain EVERY TIME I go to use my horn."
26142,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.7320454120635986,"Minus the control buttons, it has some 1980s Buick vibes"

26145,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.8686927556991577, Both my Nissan and Kia cars have better steering wheel controls and I always eventually notice
26146,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9900822043418884," I get they want me to use the big screen or voice commands but simple things like changing Audio Source, answering and hanging up the phone, etc are best from a wheel with dedicated controls."
26147,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9846426844596864,Delivered with front camera?
26148,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9986250400543212,Is stalkless as big a deal as I think it is? Or do you get used to it?  maybe I’m just being too picky about it but I just don’t think I could ever go with a car that doesn’t have stalks
26149,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995173215866088,That wheel design is horrid

26153,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9972109198570251,I hate Teslas move towards these haptic blinker buttons on the steering wheel
26154,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9978041052818298,They make using roundabouts dangerous.
26155,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.975959837436676,The return of the horn being where it supposed to be to be
26156,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9992565512657166,"Any other changes? I have one on order, was hoping the new ambient lighting and front camera would have been out by now"
26157,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.998400628566742,Any new interior changes besides the steering wheel?
26158,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.8455965518951416,Maybe they’ll fix the turn signals next? We can only hope!

26165,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995383024215698,I have a 2022 with a defective yoke
26166,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9545284509658812,After seeing your post I reached out to service
26167,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9945567846298218, They said while it is on the new cars they don’t have replacement wheels or yokes in stock
26168,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9991193413734436,Still haptic?
26169,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9991258978843688,Has anyone figured out why all the refresh wheels/yokes have that vein the middle?
26170,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9993172883987428,I got used to the yoke and slamming my hand on the right side of the wheel when people are dumb
26171,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.99986732006073,Works fine
26172,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9947911500930786,"But that wheel looks better, now just need an alcantara version and a yellow stripe on top"

26175,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9994109869003296,I'd rather have the yoke.
26176,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9977059364318848,Do the buttons *click* like the Model 3 Highland?
26177,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9996213912963868,Interesting to see the evolution of the Tesla into a real car
26178,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9953998923301696,Maybe one day they will bring the ultrasonic sensors back and stop pretending they need to reinvent the wheel on every component
26179,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9922014474868774, Like that insanely large 48V windshield wiper on the cyber truck

26184,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9892374277114868,The Tesla name being imprinted and not chrome looks so cheap for a premium car

26192,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9976358413696288,These new steering wheels are the epitome of Tesla's terrible design choices
26193,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9997640252113342,"Between this, no stalks, the panel gaps, and shitty wipers, I'll definitely be looking elsewhere when it's time to upgrade my Model 3."
26194,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9910176992416382,Signals on the wheel still? No thanks.

26223,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9996181726455688,Looks super cheap compared to my 2017 S
26224,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9944595098495485,Maybe it’s just the lighting / exposure
26225,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9957112073898317,On the subject of physical buttons: the newer S’s would be a bit more interesting if they had turn a signal stalk
26226,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995179176330566,Losing that was also a big safety question.

26310,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9917404651641846,And I drive a lot
26311,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9941300749778748,Maybe I’m just not in an angry area.
26312,2024-02-28 07:47:01,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9997877478599548,It actually seems pretty much guaranteed

26697,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.999698281288147,  Agreed
26698,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9980803728103638, This is really my only complaint with all of the input hardware reduction in the new S and X
26699,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9790873527526855, My X was an inventory vehicle and came with the yoke
26700,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9967807531356812, I had been considering replacing it immediately with the wheel until the Tesla associate pointed out that the turn signals are still buttons on the wheel

26702,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9916368126869202, But the wheel-button turn signals required some pretty concerted muscle memory effort and I'm still only 90% accurate with them when exiting roundabouts

26706,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9998689889907836, I instantly loved it on my drive home through the mountains after picking the car up.

26738,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9997990727424622,Agree very much with your thoughts on turning signal stalk.

26740,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.99980491399765,Spot on
26741,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995525479316713,   I’ll add the following comments…   The horn button being a capacitive button rather than on the middle of the steering wheel is a major design error for two reasons: one is that I hit it by accident all the time using the right thumb wheel; and secondly years of driving cars with the horn in the middle means that in a panic situation the horn isn’t available to my instinct
26742,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9998026490211488,I think this is a dumb design that should be fixed immediately
26743,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.999113142490387,"  The yoke looks cool, and is functional, and the shape has few downsides to me"

26745,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9794549942016602,Even 3-point turns are no problem at all

26750,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9990153312683104,  It’s so much quieter than the 3
26751,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9998807907104492,Love that
26752,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9782629609107972,  The turn radius on the S is wider
26753,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9994183778762816,"  The repeater cameras that come up with turn signals should be on the instrument cluster, not the touch screen"
26754,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9969678521156312,"  Now, whether these upgrades are worth the cost difference is a personal decision"
26755,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9993271827697754,But completely agree with OP.

26760,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9994124174118042,Also the button horn/no horn in center of wheel (which I believe they have corrected in newer models)  is as dumb & dangerous as the blinkers.

26767,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9976383447647096,"Isn’t the S platform now severely outdated - yes it got a minor refresh with current screens but the overall body and to the best of my knowledge, suspension (maybe adaptive suspension addition is a significant upgrade) and handling, did not materially change in the 2022 refresh from the 10 year old original"
26768,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9980363249778748,"  Given the upcoming M3 Highland that apparently has significant upgrades in suspension and interior comfort ( at 25-30k less), I wonder how the current S would stack against it"
26769,2023-11-29 04:50:03,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9994182586669922,  My main issue with the S is its size- too large ( wide) for day to day driving and city/ garage  parking

28409,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9970064759254456,"So I 3D printed a little piece that wedges up behind the mirror and covers the driver's side of the camera, and I no longer feel like the AP system is a manic schizophrenic"

28431,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9983652234077454, I even removed our home WiFi and the daily nag to upgrade went away

28436,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.964108109474182,Wear sunglasses
28437,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9802716374397278,I also love how they put the alerts to keep hands on the wheel or bad weather at the bottom left of the screen
28438,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9902894496917723,Why not move it up closer to where the listed speed is? It's like they're encouraging your head to bend down and get a nag
28439,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9726575016975404,"Because to me, it's more about your head tilting than it is your eyeballs gazing slightly to the right"
28440,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9983729124069214,Also maybe cut down on the various nags
28441,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9869545102119446,I love when it's raining and they send me alert every three seconds that bad weather is detected and fsd is limited
28442,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.6186738014221191,Like obviously I can see it's raining
28443,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9994480013847352,Plus the other crazy thing is it's not really detecting bad weather
28444,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9850113987922668,It's really just detecting that your windshield wipers on at a higher setting.

28453,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9199345111846924,"So I wonder, you could just close your eyes and it won’t notice anything"

28458,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9770100116729736,I keep a baseball cap in my Model Y for driving at night just for this reason.

28461,2024-02-27 03:48:06,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9618163108825684,I now realize that it probably was because I was wearing a baseball cap for the first time in a long time!

29289,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.6294031143188477,I'm guessing it was because the car in the left lane was coming up on me pretty quickly
29290,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995750784873962," It stayed halfway into the left lane for 6-7 seconds, just long enough to really piss the other car off"
29291,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9988344311714172, Why it couldn't just accelerate to match the other lanes speed and move over I don't get
29292,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9990347623825072, Why did I buy a performance it FSD wont use even 25% of its acceleration?  It then signaled and move back left
29293,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9997782111167908, How utterly stupid.
29294,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.975246012210846,Yeah I'd love to try a v12 version of Highway FSD whenever it comes out.
29295,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9840885400772096,"Keep using the autopilot profile until it’s upgraded to V12, then try it again"
29296,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9931989312171936,It seriously blew my mind how much better it is on city streets at least.
29297,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9981995820999146,Did you make sure to turn on the option for HOV lane in the navigation? I have a friend who said he hated FSD because it kept moving him out of the HOV lane
29298,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9982853531837464,"We found out he didn’t have the HOV option on in the navigation settings, and now he is happy with it"
29299,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9972140192985536,"When I use the minimal lane change option, it won’t move me at all unless I am approaching my exit"
29300,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995941519737244,"Let’s say you wanted to prevent FSD from changing lanes as your exit approached, you could simply cancel the navigation in which case the car will just go straight forever until you enter in a destination again"
29301,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9916627407073976,EAP will do the same thing and want you to change lanes as you approach your exit
29302,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9842055439949036,There is nothing different here.
29303,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9865254163742064,OP states they already tried that
29304,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9997703433036804,It doesn’t work anyways
29305,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9936635494232178, It will change lanes regardless.
29306,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9991388320922852,  Actually maintained speed to keep the traffic flow even as limit lowered
29307,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,POSITIVE,0.9998781681060792,Great intel I will check that out thank you!
29308,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9992421865463256,Unless you signal to cancel it....which is what I do.
29309,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9981995820999146,Until it decides to challenge you to a pissing match
29310,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.998393714427948,I had to cancel a lane change 4 times until I just disengaged AP
29311,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9995582699775696,It had it in its mind that it wanted to change lanes and I wasn't going to convince it otherwise.
29312,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.998493790626526, I get really annoyed with trying to get it over into the slow lane when passing lanes open up and it'll often fight me
29313,2024-05-06 00:53:20,TSLA,NEGATIVE,0.9965102076530457, One time I didn't have anyone behind me so I tried it for lulz without disengaging and it went back into the lane and cancelled my signal 3 times which was enough to never get over because it was a short passing lane.
