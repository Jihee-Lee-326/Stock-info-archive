128,2024-07-19 21:53:03,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.997796893119812,I can tell you exactly why things like this happen.   Companies used to rely heavily on QA but new age of move fast and break things stupidity has resulted in a lot of companies culling dedicated Qa teams and using devs who write code to test these.   Devs test with a huge positive bias for their code in their mind plus most of the devs do not have end to end system understanding.   This causes extremely precarious situation where products get shipped with just unit testing and integration testing.   Add to this the new age product churn from product management team which pushed devs to deliver on certain strict time lines.   Combine this and you have a recipe for disaster waiting to happen.

Or the broken permission functionalities, where you assign a role to one user and he's able to use a system, but if you assign the same role to another, nothing works?  Well, those are not deal breakers for me, but the platform is just so much all over the place in design and functionality"

16487,2023-05-22 02:12:32,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9567286372184752, It was 85% Azure in the finance space and a mix of some AWS projects

19946,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9964654445648192,I think she (Tess) stole the identity of her girlfriend after she died and took her name (Sophie)
19947,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9975631237030028,I think she’s lived under different identities and that makes it harder to put together her memories
19948,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9748007655143738,  I think she was a Talented Mr Ripley type who got amnesia trying to get away from someone she had crossed
19949,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.999272882938385,"She was trying to run game on James from the beginning, which is how she recognized he was also full of shit and that wasn’t his house"
19950,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9978420734405518,  I still think she’s the master manipulator but she got bored when she and James “won the game” by getting him to the top of his career
19951,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9997147917747498,"So she started some chaos and planned to run off with the money.,"
19952,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9993764758110046,Is it me or is James getting less and less attractive as the episodes go on?
19953,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9995912909507751,"They're just going to ignore possibly dead ex-GF until S2, aren't they? :/  PS- the fuck kind of obscure security question was that?"
19954,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9996423721313475,Did anyone else think a third somebody was holding the camera in their sexy tape? Why did she rewind it?
19955,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9736980199813844,Me too! I'm glad they added a good explanation why she saw a man standing at the rail.
19956,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9647817015647888,I still have doubts she jumped
19957,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9976589679718018,I wonder if that is real or not
19958,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9989162683486938,If it is was she running from someone or threatening to jump to get away from a person
19959,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9987347722053528,Maybe she did jump but we know the letter to James was a good bye letter and that she had money and seemed to plan to leave and that may have been a pattern for her
19960,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9994150400161744,It seems like jumping wasn’t planned if it happened
19961,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9831872582435608, Why wasn’t she able to see this footage before
19962,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.99968421459198,She clearly doesn’t believe she jumped and she has no reason to trust the people around her
19963,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9913070797920228,There has been no proof until this episode that she jumped
19964,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9978686571121216,I feel like this would have at least given her something concrete to work with.
19965,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9943804144859314,I think Tess is her real name and she stole the identity of her girlfriend (the one with the bloody face) after she died.
19966,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9009050726890564,Yeah it’s suspicious for sure!
19967,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.7566060423851013,"Lets see—The Tess storyline, her entire backstory of why she ran away and started over as Sophie (which might be one and the same), whoever was on the boat with her that made her jump, whatever else James is lying about, the therapist being a plant, what caused James’ best friend to have a serious grudge against Sophie, and how she broke her arm"
19968,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9992098808288574,"   I think that’s it? Also him getting away with wire Fraud is a super weak storyline, like he’s always stressed, than calm about it"
19969,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9955097436904908,I can’t tell if he’s been seriously exposed or not.
19970,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9993333220481871,"Yeahhhh they told that guy on the roof he was cop, so that must be what blew his cover right?"
19971,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9984086155891418,So is James good or bad? Seems like he had someone kill her boyfriend.
19972,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.977465033531189,"This show isn’t a limited series, so it’s possible we can get some type of cliffhanger on the last episode."
19973,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9946297407150269,Yeahhhh I was wondering about the math of that money as well.
19974,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.99825781583786,I assumed it was the only money James wasn't able to track or withdraw because she'd shifted it to the Tess account
19975,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9989510774612428,"Bader's voicemail said the deposit to Tess Caldwell's account was only 3 mil, and Sophie said James has been trying to track the money all this time"
19976,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.997454822063446,"And James's conservatorship is technically over Sophie, not Tess, so he can't just access the money himself"
19977,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9437198638916016,It has to be her.
19978,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9975221753120422,"Well James found out tonight that Harrison had hired the cop/lover, so maybe he didn’t know about it?"
19979,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9892680048942566,James is deffo a master manipulator
19980,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9841030836105348,He’s very slick but like the whole time I can’t shake this feeling he’s trying to make her believe a different story from what happened but he has to improvise a lot whenever Sophie remembers something
19981,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9990276098251344,Also getting a therapist to manipulate her patient is fucked up on another level
19982,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9988380074501038,  I still wonder about why Sophie used to be tess and why they would tell her her name is Sophie in the ambulance? So I had this thought what if she is an undercover agent herself? Would explain why the other agent was following her AND why they would have to tell her her fake name in the ambulance! But now how does all the rest fit into this? Did James find out she is an undercover cop? Like how long have they been married?! What the hell would he have to do to warrant that level of investigation? Possibly I’m dead wrong in my theory this is hella confusing
19983,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9993715882301332,What if James and Harrison actually had a thing? I would not put this past this show for a bunch of bisexual love triangles to be going on.
19984,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9962142109870912,I’m getting more and more convinced she was an undercover agent
19985,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9994150400161744,"But then why did she jump? Did she want to get away with the money by faking her death because that was the only way to get out of this clusterfuck? If the husband found out she is a cop that could get really uncomfortable for her if he is willing to get that other cop killed to cover this up  Wait, does this actually make sense? I feel like I just solved the puzzle but I’m too high to tell"
19986,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.6369461417198181,Help.
19987,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9444532990455629,I truly believe she is the manipulator here.
19988,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.999456226825714,Yes and she was trying to fake her death and then maybe swim rest of the way to storage units where she hit everything she needed to start a new life
19989,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.98695170879364,With her old passport as Tess and old memories from her past life
19990,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9995588660240172,That is my theory but everything blew up in her face.
19991,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9140878319740297,James may be but not the actor who plays him certainly still is!
19992,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9994561076164246,"His voice is grading lol, he didn’t talk as much in the beginning."
19993,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9961191415786744,I thought it was a typical question like mothers maiden name
19994,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.999552309513092,What I found ridiculous was that it was a multiple choice question like this is not who wants to be a millionaire lady you’re a bank for fucks sake
19995,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9970115423202516,"It’s a limited series, so we should find out in the next episode."
19996,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.7832462191581726,Because it was her realization that she never planned on leaving her husband for Baden.
19997,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9747801423072816,Like it was just a guy running to look to see what happened?  But…now that I think about it maybe Harrison was on that boat and told her something that would make her jump
19998,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.999268352985382,That will be the twist.
19999,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9978376030921936,"Oh yeah, why wouldn’t the cop/lover have showed her that footage sooner?!   Also it kinda seemed like James was involved in the cop/lover’s death."
20000,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9981313347816468,Yeah there’s definitely going to be one more twist.
20001,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9812286496162416,"What if she never even fell off the boat at all? Now that'd be really damn crazy, but the woman is a different persona nearly every episode"
20002,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9514204859733582,I'm wondering...
20003,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9998304843902588,"Oh, snap, that's a cool theory"
20004,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.968049168586731,I actually don't think the girlfriend is dead though.

20007,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.989597499370575,I think James is good and his friend at work appears to be the one that’s not such a good guy
20008,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.720509946346283,I think it was him—James’ work friend that outed Baden
20009,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9988769888877868," They tried too hard to make James look like a bad guy for too long, so I think he isn’t truly bad—he just makes bad decisions."
20010,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9996378421783448,When was a storage unit mentioned?  I think I missed that.
20011,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.9996115565299988,What? His voice is divine!

20019,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,POSITIVE,0.96929931640625,Harrison hired Baden
20020,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9972298741340636,Did anyone ever look her up in England? And did they look up the name Tess or her fingerprints in other countries? It seems weird that Baden would fall in love with her and Harrison didn’t do a social media search or look her up online first.
20021,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9993752837181092,"When Baden found the name Tess Caldwell on a bank account linked to stolen money did he check it out?

20022,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.989270031452179,James or Harrison probably outed him as a cop

20029,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.995191216468811,He said he didn’t know he was a cop.
20030,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.988463819026947,YES DUDE thank you! I thought I was going crazy like how is no one in here bringing this up? Like I don’t remember all the details but everything I can remember fits together and we only don’t know what James did for the cops to go deep undercover like this  So there was James crime -> investigation-> ??? -> she jumps off the boat -> James is trying to cover up he knew she’s a cop and he’s trying to keep the evidence of whatever he did (I don’t think wirefraud was his first crime) from reaching the law
20031,2022-08-26 10:00:11,MSFT,NEGATIVE,0.9991876482963562,-> something we don’t know about black cop? -> where will this go once she knows he knows?  Edit: he was literally trying to tell her a new personal history hoping she would forget she was a cop?
