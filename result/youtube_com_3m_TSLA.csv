1,We need a sunroof back on the model s and X,NEGATIVE,0.9981505274772644
2,"I still own a 2017 Model X I bought new.  Never been to service center.  Only maintenance have been tires.  I charge at home with solar.  Save $500/month on gas and home electricity.  No more oil filters in landfills every 5000 miles.  No petrochemical odors in cabin.  I recently bought another Tesla, a Model Y.  Transferred FSD from X to Y.  Wow, FSD has really improved.  Definitely a level 3 with minimal intervention needed.  I just moved to a new city.  It‚Äôs a game changer navigating in new surroundings",POSITIVE,0.9925904273986816
3,I could be remembering wrong but i think trump said he would end the &quot;mandate&quot; on day one. The EV mandates are not the insensitive from the inflation reduction act. Honestly ending the mandates would kind of do nothing so who cares.,NEGATIVE,0.9670722484588623
4,Video says Trump is saying he&#39;ll remove the tax credits.  That&#39;s incorrect he said the mandate to have all electric cars (no other choices like ICE cars for Americans).  He&#39;s not said he&#39;s removing the current tax credits.,NEGATIVE,0.9969887137413025

14,Tesla bot arm will match what we saw in T2 when the Terminator and John go to Miles house to try and stop the future from happening. The Terminator cuts his skin to show the metal skeleton in the arm. I knew they would need to design it this way. James Cameron is an extremely detailed movie Director.,POSITIVE,0.9915181994438171

18,Elon also said at the 10/10 event some may not understand what they are seeing until the future when they look back. I think that was an interesting tip on what we might see at the unveiling. Can we get a panel to discuss what Elon‚Äôs comment might mean?,POSITIVE,0.9674438834190369

21,"I live in Thailand. I have never heard an EV owner, regardless of it being Tesla, BYD, GAC, MG, ChangAn, going back to ICE. Our next car will be EV.",POSITIVE,0.9871204495429993
22,"An idiot online posted that today‚Äôs ICE cars burn so clean it negates the benefits of EVs. So I challenged him to the garage test. I told him to run his clean ICE with the door closed. I would do the same in my EV. Well, he died. No, he just ignored me from then on.",NEGATIVE,0.9997709393501282
23,That statistic is meaningless unless you know the proportion of total population traded. If 5% of Tesla owners trade with a dealer and 50% choose ICE then 2.5% of Tesla owners are reverting to ICE. Not that high really? Bear in mind you would not be at a dealership if you were swapping to another Tesla (as most do). My guess is those people had financial difficulties and needed to lower their repayments by swapping to a cheap ICE car. ü§î,NEGATIVE,0.9997209906578064
24,"Everyone is absolutely misunderstanding what Edmunds is saying. Read what they are saying here carefully: <br>&quot;More than half of Teslas traded in at dealerships so far in 2024 were traded in for a gas vehicle.&quot; Note that Tesla doesn&#39;t have dealerships or gas cars to trade. <br><br>So here is what that means. A survey done by Bloomberg in the US recently: &quot;Tesla still maintains an 87% brand retention rate, outperforming two non-electric automakers at 67% with Lexus and 54% at Toyota. 81% of prospective Tesla buyers are new customers switching from competing EV brands compared to 42% of Nissan‚Äôs prospective buyers.&quot;<br><br>Not a small detail that people are misunderstanding here. Teslas traded in at legacy dealerships are a small percentage of overall Teslas being traded in. So the 13% of non-loyal Tesla customers traded in at legacy dealerships and are trading in for legacy dealership gas cars with the other half being traded in for legacy dealership EVs. This is a smaller subset of used Teslas being traded in. The other 87% is being traded in for new Teslas. So if Tesla has a 87% loyalty rate for returning customers that means that the other 13% are being traded in at legacy dealerships half of which are traded in for legacy EVs. That means only around 7.5% of used Teslas are traded in for ICEs.  <br><br>So Edmunds needs to correct this and change their headline to: Out of the 13% of Teslas that aren&#39;t traded back into Tesla for a new Tesla, 50% of those are traded in for a gas car. But that wouldn&#39;t create as much hysteria and get as many clicks.",NEGATIVE,0.9990131855010986
25,"Edmund‚Äôs data is probably deeply biased. I imagine they‚Äôre only looking at dealership data, which would skew the data towards ICE. Legacy makers don‚Äôt offer many good EVs, so if a Tesla is being traded at a dealership, it would make sense that it‚Äôs traded for something on the lot.",NEGATIVE,0.9994670748710632
26,I could never go back to an ICE car after owning a Model 3 for 6 years.  It would be interesting to know about these folks trading their Tesla for ICE.  Apartment dwellers?  Like cars that go &quot;vroom vroom&quot;?  Married an auto mechanic?  Turned off by Elon&#39;s politics?,NEGATIVE,0.9962249994277954
27,No way would I ever go back to ICE cars ever again,NEGATIVE,0.9921554923057556
28,I am keeping my Tesla Model Y and I live in California. Have solar on the house so charging is very cheap. Love the car.,POSITIVE,0.9947348833084106
29,"I think it&#39;s likely that there is a flaw in the study.  If you were intending to replace your Tesla with an other Tesla, you could sell the old one on the private market or trade in the car with Tesla, which does not have dealerships.  So these cases would not be included in the study.",NEGATIVE,0.9996200799942017

105,"I bought a used 2022 Model 3 for $18,900 after the Federal Rebate, and I own it outright. The lease for the RWD Model 3 might make the most financial sense if you want to drive a brand-new car, but you are limited to 10,000 miles. So, if you drive a lot, you cannot recoup your investment in gas savings. It would be interesting to see how much the trade-in value is after the lease is completed.  <br><br>I figured that the money I invested to purchase my 2022 Model 3 actually is earning about 8% annually in gas savings. This ROI is guaranteed so long as I don&#39;t have an accident or the car breaks down. Since the Model 3 is perhaps the most reliable EV made, I don&#39;t foresee it breaking down. I also calculated that if I drive the car for approximately 18000 - 20,000 miles, it will have paid for itself in gas savings, using $4.00 per gallon as a metric. This does not include savings on oil changes, brake changes, fluid replacements and other ICE maintenance cost savings. I also own a 4-wheel Drive Toyota. It gets about 15 mpg in the city, so I save a ton of money on gas in comparison.<br><br>If I drive this Model 3 for more than 20,000 miles, it will be paying me to own it as opposed to driving my Tacoma. This is an almost guaranteed financial return of 8%, and that ROI is hard to find right now unless you take significant risks.",NEGATIVE,0.9963231086730957

The car is fantastic, but the rear seat room is nearly non-existent. The front seats are comfortable and have just enough room (still tighter than my M3P). The mileage in the M3P is better and because it has a smaller battery the charging is faster. The driving experience of the BMW is fabulous, but so is the Tesla. I like the Tesla interior design language, so I vote for the M3P, but the interior of the BMW is more classically incredible, so my wife voted for the i4 M50.
