1,"I really want to love the Sidewinder, even tried the new attachments on it. But it just doesn’t work, it isn’t the recoil, it’s the goddamn firing stability. That stupid excessive wobble coupled with the smokey streaks it leaves behind that doesn’t let you see shit sometimes. If they can up the velocity by 150, take those streaks out or make them less visible, and buff the firing stability, it would be perfect. The low ammo and slowness to it keeps it balanced.",NEGATIVE,0.9782841801643372

57,I absolutely love the quest 3. The upgrade is well worth it. They are constantly updating and making it even better. For a standalone headset it&#39;s a must have. I am happy with my purchase and look forward to what&#39;s in store for the future.,POSITIVE,0.9998704195022583

60,"You have to keep in mind that the headset has vignetting because of the pancake lenses, basically the rim of your vision appears to darken rather than stay the same brightness like on the Quest 2. It can be jarring for some people, and you’ll probably need to increase the brightness as well, the screen isn’t as bright as the quest 2. <br><br>One of the benefits of the Q3 is that you can get half-body tracking if you install the beta version of virtual desktop. Essentially tracking down to your waste. Also the fov is a better, especially horizontally, and the resolution is higher/crisper.",NEGATIVE,0.9970000386238098

63,"Well I went right for buying the Quest 3.  Has more powerful processor, Better pancake lenses, Nice color passthrough, and playing my PCVR SIM racing games connected via USB link cable. All in all it has been a great upgrade from my Oculus Rift S.<br>Only change I did is replace the original head strap with the BoboVR S3 Pro head strap.  Besides better comfort, it provides me a battery which has larger capacity for playing even longer times with the Quest 3.<br>Hand controllers are only used for selecting menus and work very good.

VR has made gaming such a huge upgrade and whoever&#39;s gonna buy a Quest 3, trust me it&#39;s gonna be worth it, it&#39;s an underrated VR with much power and specs as you can see everywhere all over the internet. Seeing the VR industry grow time to time makes me wonder what else wil change gaming in the future.
