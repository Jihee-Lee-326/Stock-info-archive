845,2024-05-28 02:36:20,AMZN,NEGATIVE,0.8935664296150208,"  But late 2010s come along and more of the AWS style functionality becomes increasingly more accessible to on premise architectures - improvements in tools like Ansible (IBM), Terraform (Hashicorp/IBM), Kubernetes (from Google) (and countless others) made it easier for on prem departments to deploy ""cloud native"" services"
846,2024-05-28 02:36:20,AMZN,NEGATIVE,0.9856094717979432,"But still, even after that, on prem IT departments need super expensive engineers to code out all of the complexities of a departments infrastructure"
