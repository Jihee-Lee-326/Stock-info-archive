3,2024-04-29 18:05:20,GOOGL,NEGATIVE,0.985044240951538,For example Disney is over 100 years old and just within 3 years it went from 200$ a share down to 80$ and now up to 120$

10,2024-04-29 18:05:20,GOOGL,NEGATIVE,0.9692766666412354," If you think Alphabet is fairly valued and you believe in their growth story, why should it be to late? On the other hand, if you have no idea how they could grow going forward, you should take a closer look at it or continue your research with other companies"
11,2024-04-29 18:05:20,GOOGL,NEGATIVE,0.9745566248893738,Don’t invest just because of fomo or some influencer is telling to

16,2024-04-29 18:05:20,GOOGL,POSITIVE,0.9945532083511353,But if you believe the company does have a MOAT and will keep making money for decades you can jump in now aswell
17,2024-04-29 18:05:20,GOOGL,POSITIVE,0.9875774383544922,"They give 3.5% return on buybacks, + growth"

28,2024-04-29 18:05:20,GOOGL,NEGATIVE,0.9942333102226256,"Are you bullish are their cloud segment? It's behind AWS and Azure but I've heard their product is superior in some ways?   How do you feel about their other bets? Android OS, Waymo which is ahead of their competitors, Google docs wide spread use, and sure Geminis isn't as well known at chatgpt but their functionality from my use is the same and can you even name a 3rd competitor?   I'm Long googl"

32,2024-04-29 18:05:20,GOOGL,NEGATIVE,0.997646152973175,Suggesting it could be too late to invest in them long term is suggesting it’ll still be worth $172 years or decades from now…

If it does not you could just skip it, the only issue is detection, which either needs some distributed approach comparing video between users, some AI or probably some detectable UI change on the client exits"
15248,2024-06-13 00:34:12,GOOGL,NEGATIVE,0.9994398951530457,"After all, they have to disable skipping in the UI or regular users would just get errors when trying to use the UI to skip"
15249,2024-06-13 00:34:12,GOOGL,NEGATIVE,0.9997712969779968,So they have to somehow provide the information.  Problem is this will probably take months for ad blockers to figure out and implement.
